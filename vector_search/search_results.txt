Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and 743 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, 890 million on expense, and 647 million of net income. Now, focusing on the firmwide fourth-quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of 38.1 billion was up 2.5 billion or 7% year on year.NII ex markets was up 2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex markets was up 139 million or 1%, and markets revenue was up 141 million or 2%. Expenses of 23.6 billion were up 4.6 billion or 24% year on year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit cost were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.2 billion and a net reserve build for 474 million. Net charge-offs were up 1.3 billion, predominantly driven by card and single name exposures in wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in card and the deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the commercial bank. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and revenue of $162 billion.\n\n\n\n\n And we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains, and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds toward the proposed Basel III endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year on year, driven by strong account growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of 4.4 billion on revenue of 17 billion, which was up 8% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was up 6% year on year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with average balances down 8% year on year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In home lending, revenue was up 230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII. Moving to card services and auto, revenue was up 8% year on year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were 9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of 8.7 billion were up 10% year on year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees primarily in bankers, advisors and technology, and wage inflation as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs, which were up 791 million year on year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card.\n\n\n\n\n The net reserve build of 538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB on Page 6. The CIB reported net income of 2.5 billion on revenue of 11 billion. Investment banking revenue of 1.6 billion was up 13% year on year. IB fees were also up 13% year on year, and we ended the year ranked No. 1 with a wallet share of 8.8%. In advisory, fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior-year quarter with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was 2.3 billion, up 10% year on year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to markets. Total revenue was 5.8 billion, up 2% year on year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue and rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash.\n\n\n\n\n Securities services revenue of 1.2 billion was up 3% year on year. Expenses of 6.8 billion were up 4% year on year predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were 210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of 121 million and a net reserve build of 89 million. Moving to the commercial bank on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of 3.7 billion was up 7% year on year, largely driven by higher NII where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of 2 billion was up 2% year on year, driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of 924 million was up 32% year on year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of 1.4 billion were up 9% year on year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year on year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients continue to opt for higher-yielding alternatives and flat quarter on quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were 269 million, including net charge-offs of 127 million and a net reserve build of 142 million, driven by a deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and wealth management reported net income of 925 million with pre-tax margin of 28%.\n\n\n\n\n Revenue of 4.7 billion was up 2% year on year driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances, partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of 3.4 billion were up 11% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were 12 billion, positive across equities and fixed income and 140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of 49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of 242 billion for the full year. And we have record client asset net inflows of 489 billion for the year. AUM of 3.4 trillion and client assets of 5 trillion were both up 24% year on year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 7% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of 689 million. Revenue of 1.8 billion was up 597 million year on year. NII of 2.5 billion was up 1.2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of 687 million, compared with a net loss of 115 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of 3.4 billion were up 3 billion year on year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on Page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex markets to be approximately 88 billion.\n\n\n\n\n Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in card to continue but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full-year guidance of approximately 88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in markets NII, which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on this slide, we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll hear more at investor day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firm line drivers.\n\n\n\n\n Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about 400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes: bankers, branches, advisors, technology, as well as marketing. Net-net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as a result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects on inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed, both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to Page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with investor-day guidance. So, in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were overearning as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path toward normalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities.And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. \n\n\n\n\n Questions & Answers: OperatorPlease stand by. For our first question, it's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium-term outlook that you've put out there?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I'm not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. And I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the overearning, so not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlighted on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full-year guidance of 88, that implies obviously exiting below 88 and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that 80. Whether we ever get to the 80 or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n OK. And then just separately, you bought back a couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Good question. And I think you've framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buyback, consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.\n\n\n\n\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Thanks, Matt.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.\n\n\n\n\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions? And how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate and the number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously, you can see that skew and the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6 peak off the current levels.\n\n\n\n\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. And then just a follow-up on the NII. Could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts, like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts? And how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EAR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q, but on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower.\n\n\n\n\n So, I think something like 1.9 as opposed to 2.1. So, just round number is about 2 billion in EAR. I think empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the line effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think you -- as I noted, we do remain asset sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that. And hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. Thanks. \n\n\n\n\nOperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits. Can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Both good questions. So, let's just -- let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs and wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher just even in a world with six cuts. And, you know, that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little nonintuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with like change rates and change in rate pay that gets a little bit nonintuitive.And then in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year continues. And that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rate. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin a little bit more supportive for systemwide deposit balances. And then obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.\n\n\n\n\nJim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Right. OK. Thanks a lot.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. \n\n\n\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey, good morning. I guess maybe one question. Looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear -- I'm not sure if Jamie's on the call, but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around, do you believe that the outlook for soft landing has increased as the market pricing incorrectly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lag effects of the rate hikes?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. OK, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing.\n\n\n\n\n That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumers find all of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take, but I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously, we always worry about the scenario, is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst And maybe just taking that a step further there, has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE being filtered into multifamily apartments. You all have a pretty large multifamily exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial retail or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, good question on the multifamily. And the short answer is that for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no, no bleed through. And the reason is that while there is we do -- we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Good. Thank you.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. Your -- on a net basis, net to RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guidepost you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that 2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for B3 finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June DFAST results, you mentioned the SCB, sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Erika, it's a good question, and I understand what you're asking, why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty. And it's kind of a probabilistic cloud in a variety of different factors, but all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients, right? Very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is the buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with a modest pace for now.\n\n\n\n\n But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the 90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or could the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for '24?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n A little bit of that is in there, yes. So, you would see that we often talk about the volume and revenue-related category. And I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about $1 billion increase in that category year on year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So, the hope and expectation of continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you.Operator\n\n\n\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year over year. It seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that, I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay? How much of that due to tech? How much of that due to AI, and what are the expected returns to get to that $7 billion pickup? Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yep, Mike. Thanks for the question. And yeah, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at investor day and between now and investor day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we use on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year on year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our card products. And so, that shows off in marketing.\n\n\n\n\n And as you all know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. You know, I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs, and some of them are much longer term, and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The commercial bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of adds that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent theme to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers, both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes I think both our very, very strong share position as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.\n\n\n\n\n Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually pretty consistent across the entire firm even though it's really bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been: new products, features, and customer platforms as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company, both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about the driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. I have a short follow-up. I'm still here.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I asked you this before, and you said you're spending it. You're being careful. You want to see a return on your dollars.\n\n\n\n\n But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much should AI make a difference? Just a little bit more meat on the tech bones.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point. And I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff, and I'll save that for investor day, if you don't mind. But I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have to reach Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the operating committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that -- I think of this as being a little bit barbelled where, on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase.\n\n\n\n\n We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way. It's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Right. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Thanks, Mike.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi, Jeremy. How are you?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker? Or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Gerard. I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n OK. Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook, you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that it hasn't -- QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment.\n\n\n\n\n I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from systemwide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset hopefully by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of systemwide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so, that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's -- the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So -- and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in systemwide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also, I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Gerard.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\n\n\n\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There's been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there? And how the rate in -- how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM, and DCM?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yes, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is, of course, supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps higher and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change. So, sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then M&A, it's a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple of nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024 all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.\n\n\n\n\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. And on the flip side in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down? Or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets to open up even more?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a -- I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out.\n\n\n\n\n The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about capex and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yep.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi, thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance, and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is how big of a trend is this? How much do you think of it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment.\n\n\n\n\n It's something that we've been watching for some time. We have made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively, both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses but also go head to head with the private credit providers and these types of unitranche structures if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and uncertainty of execution. And we can provide both of our sort of exceptionally strong longtime DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the commercial bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III end game, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. So, more to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours, too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people and regulators, in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Anything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business, too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we're going to look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n OK, cool. Thank you for that.OperatorAnd for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Thank you. Another question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming because you'll have a full year and '24 First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from 3.7 billion this year to 5 billion to 6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or -- I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjusted rate mortgages that I assume pricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic probably be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at investor day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise.\n\n\n\n\n Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull-to-par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR from my response to the prior question because that EAR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Just to make sure I understood what you're saying. So, you have NII ex market went from 94 to 88. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic being down as well or up?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer It's kind of matched the day we did it. So, yes, I mean I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, in 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023 as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull-to-par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of -- that pull-to-par happens quite quickly and therefore, probably juice the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then it's just like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there.\n\n\n\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst All right. Thank you.OperatorAnd we do have no further questions at this time.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation, please standby.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.5 billion, EPS of $2.57, and revenue of $29.2 billion, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Underlying performance continues to be strong. Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across Consumer and Wholesale with average balances up 7% year-on-year.We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the Company were up 3% year-on-year, excluding the impact of home lending loan sales from prior quarters.Client investment assets in Consumer & Business Banking were up 27% and Asset and Wealth Management, AUM, was up 19%, reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic growth. We ranked Number one for the full year in global IB fees with 9% wallet share and growth IB revenue in the Commercial Bank was a record $2.7 billion.\n\n\n\n\nIn CIB markets, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year. However, it's important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms, in fact a record fourth quarter. And credit performance continues to be strong across the Company.On to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII. Non-interest revenue was up $2.6 billion or 21% on higher revenue in CIB markets and AWM and continued strong performance in home lending and auto.Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 4% on volume and revenue-related costs. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations.Turning to the full-year results on Page 3; the firm reported net income of $36.4 billion with EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion, all records and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Revenue was up $7.2 billion or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Non-interest revenue was up $5.1 billion or 9%, driven by growth across Consumer and higher CIB markets revenue and expenses of $65.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue-related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.\n\n\n\n\nRevenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year. And on credit, performance remained strong throughout 2019. Credit costs were $5.6 billion. In Consumer, credit costs were up $210 million reflecting an increase in card due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit costs in home lending,. And in wholesale, we were up $504 million, largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in 2018.Moving to the balance sheet and capital, on Page 4; we ended the fourth quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. And while on the topic of capital, it's worth noting, given the actions we have taken, we fully expect that we will remain in the 3.5% GSIB bucket.Before we move into the business results, I'll spend a moment talking about CECL on Page 5. As you know, the transition to CECL was effective on January 1st and therefore there is no impact to our 2019 financials. On the page is the CECL adoption impact and overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion, which is at the lower end of the range we provided.This was driven by an increase in consumer of $5.7 billion mostly coming from card, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale of $1.4 billion. In Cards, the increase is a result of moving to lifetime loss coverage versus a shorter loss emergence period under the current model, whereas in wholesale, modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecasts versus through-the-cycle loss rates under-incurred result in a decrease, especially given the forecast of credit environment.\n\n\n\n\nRecognition of the allowance increase has resulted in a $2.7 billion after-tax decrease to retained earnings, as you can see on the page. Also important to note, we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital.And now turning to the businesses, we'll start with Consumer Community Banking on Page 6. In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%, client investment assets up 27% and total loans down 6%. For the full year, results in CCB were strong with $16.6 billion of net income, up 12% and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $55.9 billion, up 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year.In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher non-interest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as account and transaction growth. Home Lending revenue was down 5%, driven by lower NII on lower balances which were down 17% reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue, reflecting a 94% increase in origination.And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto; revenue was up 9% driven by higher card NII on loan growth as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Cards loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 2%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, including market expansion, largely offset by expense efficiencies.\n\n\n\n\nOn Credit, this quarter's CCB had a net reserve release of a $150 million. This included a release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of $100 million driven by growth. Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion largely driven by card and consistent with expectations.Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7; for the fourth quarter, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year. For the full year, CIB delivered record revenue of $38 billion and an ROE of 14%. In Investment Banking, IB fees reached an all-time record for the full year.We maintained our number one rank in global IB fees and grew share to its highest level in the decade. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 million was up 6% year on year, outperforming the market which was flat. Advisory fees were down 3% following a record performance last year.On a sequential-quarter basis, fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions, and for the year, we ranked number two and gained share. Debt underwriting fees were up 11% year-on-year due to higher bond issuance activity as clients accelerated their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance sheets.\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the year, we maintained our number one rank overall and we were number one from these acquisitions in both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America.The new issuance market continue to be active, and for the year we ranked number one in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy and strategic dialogs with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance.Moving to markets; total revenue was $5 billion, up 56% year-on-year, driven by record fourth quarter revenues in both fixed income and equity markets. Fixed income markets was up 86% benefiting from a favorable comparison against the challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses, notably in securitized type products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows.Equity markets was up 15% driven by strength across cash and prime. Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, down 3% year-on-year primarily due to deposit margin compression, which was largely offset by organic growth. While Security services revenue was $1.1 billion [Phonetic], up 3%. Expenses of $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal, volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investment.\n\n\n\n\nNow moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8; Commercial Banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROE of 16% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower margins, largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on the strategic investments.Gross investment banking revenues were $634 million, up 5% year-on-year, driven by increased large-scale activity. Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion, up 10% on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking. Expenses of $882 million were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investment in banker coverage and technology.Deposit balances were up 8% year-on-year as we continue to see strong client flows. Loan balances were up 1% year-on-year. C&I loans were up 2% driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion markets, partially offset by the run-off in our tax exempt portfolio. CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher originations in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.Finally, credit costs were $110 million and NPL rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by single names which was reserved for in prior quarters. Underlying credit performance continues to be strong.\n\n\n\n\nNow on to Asset Wealth Management on Page 9; Asset Wealth Management reported net income of $785 million with pre-tax margin of 28% and ROE of 29% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, AWM generated net income of $2.8 billion with both pre-tax margin and ROE of 26%. Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year. And for the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $14 billion driven by fixed income and multi-asset and we had net liquidity inflows of $37 billion. AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client asset of $3.2 trillion, both records, were up 19% and 18% respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products. Deposits were up 8% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. And finally, we had record loan balances, up 8% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.Now on to Corporate on Page 10; Corporate reported a net loss of $361 million. Revenue was a loss of $228 million for the current quarter, driven by approximately $190 million of net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments. Sequentially, revenue was down $920 million due to lower rates, the benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales, as wells as the PE losses I just mentioned. Year-on-year revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates. Expenses of $343 million were down $165 million year-on-year due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year.And turning to Page 11 for the outlook; at Investor Day, as always, we'll give you more information on the full-year outlook. However, for now, I'll provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. We expect NII to be approximately $14 billion, market-dependent; adjusted expenses to be about $17 billion. And as a reminder, the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments, and as a result, it's currently estimated to be approximately 17% since the managed tax rate is about 500 basis points to 700 basis points higher.\n\n\n\n\nSo to wrap up; 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenue, net income and EPS. Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive, underpinned by the strength of the U.S. Consumer. And despite expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well positioned as we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business model.And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Ken.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks, good morning. Hi, Jen, how are you? Jen, I was wondering if -- in terms of the NII outlook, you talked about the $14 billion level, obviously getting to a point of stability. Can you help us -- outside of day count, can you help us understand just where we are in terms of repricing of the balance sheet? What happens if rates generally stay flat from here, just in terms of rate side of the equation, if we hold volume aside?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. As we look at rates paid, on the retail side, we didn't obviously have repriced on the way up. And so there is little to do on the way down. In fact there from a rate paid perspective, we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates paid tick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs.And then on the wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down, as you would expect and we did see betas accelerate after the second cut. So there we saw more, more of a decline in CIB than we did in CB or AWM as you might expect. Importantly though, as we always say on the wholesale side, we price client-by-client. And so we're not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta.And then, I would just say, in terms of the outlook, with the Fed on hold, the implied do still had one cut later in 2020. And based on the latest implied, we'll give you more detail at Investor Day, as we always do, but I would say NII for the full year of 2020, flat to slightly down as the headwinds from rates will be offset with balanced growth.\n\n\n\n\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah, got it. And just one question on just the volume side of things, ex the mortgage loans, sales last year, you were still in that like 3% core growth and obviously you talk a lot about this, the environment and how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level. Just, what's the status at just corporate and commercial customers now that we're closer to Phase 1 getting finalized, UMCA [Phonetic] is on the table? What's the -- what's the backdrop of just economic activity as you guys see it.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, the fourth quarter definitely, I would say, stabilized. Things trade certainly stabilized. Things, broadly speaking, stopped getting worse and so, we saw sentiment improve a bit, which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter. And then, certainly there are some puts and takes. I mean the U.S. consumer remains in very strong shape both from a credit perspective sentiment spending. Obviously labor market is very strong and the Fed and the ECB on hold, and then capital spending is still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least, certainly better than it was six months ago. So we have a, broadly speaking, constructive outlook headed -- as we're heading into 2020 here.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystHi, good morning. I have a question on credit and CECL. And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcome -- economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes and -- but CECL does materially change the way in which timing -- change the timing in which earnings accrete to book value and capital, obviously with a higher upfront hit. But you guys have also been shifting your loan book pretty materially toward cards, which have a much higher loss content than your total book.\n\n\n\n\nSo I guess a two-fold question. One is, how do we think about provisioning in this context, should we think provisioning is going to be well above charge-offs as your reserve ratio moves up, because I would think your ALLL ratio post CECL adoption, which is I think is about 1.8 1.9, it should move up as cards, which have a much higher loss content and that continue to grow in the mix. So just how do we think about provisioning in the context of the mix shift and CECL's adoption?And then, I guess secondly, if there is a change in the macro environment and the credit environment does get worse and if CECL -- that inflection goes to your reserves and your provisioning, is there a point where CECL actually does change the way you think about pricing and underwriting in that environment?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I'll start with the provisioning. So look, I think it's fair to say under CECL you could have incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macroeconomic forecasts. But there, that would depend of course on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extents of those downturn.\n\n\n\n\nin Cards specifically, as you say, in any one period of growth or a downturn, you could see an increase in reserve in the sense that we're taking life of loan versus the next nine or 12 months. So, that's true.And then on the Wholesale side, you could see some differences of course, because there are modeling differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through the cycles. Having said that, we continue to believe [Phonetic] that that incremental volatility would be material for us. And of course net charge-offs are not changing. And then from a price perspective, we don't foresee in the near term any pricing changes. The cash flows with the customer have not changed. And so we don't see any, but it is true, as you rightly pointed out that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that we're taking reserves upfront versus through time. So over time you could see that, but we're not expecting it in the near term.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystGot it. I guess on the provisioning side. My question is more just on an ongoing basis is the mix changes more toward higher loss content lending, which obviously has higher margins and higher profitability through the -- over the course of the loan. But like in that context, I would -- is it fair to say your provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs because I would think that your reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios do have to move up as that mix changes on your balance sheet it?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerIt could be -- it could be important. So that's just timing, particularly on the card side, it's just timing. But it's difficult to know, again, because it relies on our ability to have perfect foresight into the timing and extent of a downturn.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystGot it. No, that's fair. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Erika.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo, I was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results. Understand that obviously the fourth quarter ' 18 comp was light, but $3.4 billion is still a pretty heavy number for a fourth quarter for JPMorgan. So, any color you could provide would be very helpful Jennifer?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So you're taking about markets, Erika?\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystMarkets, thank you.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Okay, sure. So there -- at Goldman, in early December, I did say we expect it to be up meaningfully. I would say the performance was broad based. In rates we call out securitized products -- I'm sorry, in fixed income, we call out securitized products in rates which were bright spots. But broadly speaking, obviously equities had a very strong quarter as well. So it's really across the franchise and we saw very strong client flow and we had $0.06 monetizing those flows, so just a very healthy environment for us and really strong performance.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGot it. My follow-up question is that a quarter ago or -- and two quarters ago, the revenue backdrop for banks in general, when the outlook was starting to deteriorate. And I think management had got -- gave us some color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives, no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment. But you could cut back on certain expenses if revenue environment was changing. That being said, your revenue production seems to always outperform to the upside. So as you think about 2020, is the best way to think about expense is just at 55% overhead ratio?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo look, on the efficiency ratio, I would say that, we run the Company with great discipline, whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle. But because the efficiency ratio is an outcome, not an input and is about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any one year. We think about operating leverage over time and as we always say we're not going to change the way we run the Company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds.\n\n\n\n\nAnd on expenses, I would just say that at Investor Day last year, Marianne told you that we expected the cost curve to flatten post 2019 and 2019 adjusted expenses were up 3%. 2020, we expect them to be up less than that.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nHi.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nIs Jamie on the call?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, he is. Yeah.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nOkay. So I just -- a question for Jamie, because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity and I know this is a very simple question, but can you talk about the connection between easing trade issues and better trading and you said that was better toward the end of the year. Is this something that you expect to remain or is this a one-off quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, that's a hard question, Mike. So the obviously [Indecipherable] a lot of consternation that has eased off a little bit. I don't think we seen it completely go away. So you still have potential ongoing trade issues with China and Europe and stuff like that. But I think because that sentiment got better trading got better. But for how long that continues, we don't know.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3%, it should be less than that this year. You guys had also mentioned that your technology spending might be leveling off. So as that levels off maybe you see paybacks from prior investment, any sense of where tech spending will be this year versus the prior year and how you think about that. And I know we'll get more at Investor Day.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, of course. So I think you can think about tech spendings on a fully loaded basis being in line with what I described for the company. And we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech. but as you well know, we continuously invest in tech and so there is a fair amount of velocity in the investment portfolio there as investments roll off and we're investing in technology and innovation. So you can think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how I describe the Company in terms of trend.Operator\n\n\n\n\nOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nHi Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystTwo questions, one on asset growth. In the last couple of years fourth quarter, you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the GSIB target. And then in addition, this year, I think you sold some residential mortgage loans to investors or at least the investors are taking the risk of it and then you're requesting to have regulatory capital reflect that transfer of risk to an investor pool while you're keeping the customer relationship.When I see these things, I'm wondering how you're thinking about how much room you have for asset growth as we go into 2020 and is there an opportunity to potentially do more of this residential mortgage loan trade to free up space for growth. Maybe you could speak to that.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I mean we're bound by the standardized capital and so, of course, that is a consideration for us and one of the reasons that we're looking to structure loan sales as you described in the mortgage business. So we think that there is more we can do there. And then on GSIB, we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the Fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult. So, both are, at the margins, constraints for us, But broadly speaking, I wouldn't say that we're constrained given where we are on our capital ratios.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd as I think about CECL, appreciate the commentary you had earlier on the call. I'm just wondering, a couple of things; one, why do you think you ended up toward the low end of your $4 billion to $6 billion increase in reserves that you outlined earlier. And what kind of estimates you have for the economic outlook? You've got the assumption for the economic outlook in the reasonable supportable period etc. And so, I'm just trying to understand what kind of forecast you have in your model so that I understand what's embedded in your scenarios and in your ALR ratio?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, we -- I think we ended up at the low end, as we -- through the year, continue to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like. And so I think that's really what's driving it. Obviously, portfolio mix as well continue to be very strong in terms of performance of the portfolio.And then, on the estimates for the economic outlook, as you rightly say, there is the reasonable and supportable period which for us is two years. And so, we do use multiple weighted scenario there. So we weight multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight and that's where you went up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period which also obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nAnd Jen, are we going to disclose some of those variables over time?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officerthat's a great point Jamie. I should have said that. Yes, we -- I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q for the first quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nWhich means all the banks will be showing these ridiculous forecasting going forward and the differences and we'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerRight.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nBut we'll disclose it. You need to know to make it clear what we're doing and why we're doing it.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right. So you'll see more in the Qs.Operator\n\n\n\n\nOur next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nHi Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystTwo quick follow-ups to some themes that have been talked about. I guess first on expenses, the full-year outlook was pretty clear. Less than 3% growth, but the first quarters seems a little bit higher than maybe I would have thought, up 4% year-over-year and I don't know if that's just rounding and I'm getting too obsessed over $100 million here or there or if you are upfronting some investment spend, and if so what that's for?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nSure. So, the first quarter tend to be a bit higher for us, if you look through history and so -- but there, you can think about it, comparing it year-over-year. We have volume and revenue related expenses increasing, a bit of an increase on investments, but both are being partially offset by expense efficiency.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay. And then the other follow-up question is just on capital allocation. Obviously, it's a good problem to have. But the ratio just keep going up, the capital generation keeps going up. The stock keeps going up. You're obviously buying back a lot of stock. The goal is to get the dividend, I think, higher over time. But maybe just talk about how you think about buying back stock at these levels. If there is other call it, creative uses of capital. Like, I would think about all the money you spend on technology. Does it make sense to buy technology versus do it organic? So, just maybe address some of those things. Thank you.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nSure. So on that ratio, I'll just remind you that of course we have our capital distribution plan approved once a year. And so since our last CCAR filing, we have realized some RWA efficiency and we've out-earned relative to the assumptions in the CCAR filings. And so that's part of the reason why we've seen the ratios load up there.On stock buybacks, you know as you rightly point out, our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic growth. And so we are always looking to do that, first and foremost. And then, to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then do distribute excess capital to shareholders through buybacks and we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above 2 times tangible book which is about where we are now.We will obviously, when distributing excess capital, always be looking at the alternatives. But at a 17% ROTCE and 2% or 3% dividend payout ratio, there is a high bar to the alternative.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, you're absolutely right about acquisitions, we did do InstaMed this year, which hooks up electronics -- InstaMed hooks up providers and consumers of healthcare, while, I think the numbers are like 80% or 90% is still done by check. So if there are opportunities like that, we absolutely will be on hunt for them.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right, WePay last year. Yeah.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nAnd WePay the year before.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Operator\n\n\n\n\nOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystHi Jennifer.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nHi Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystA question on credit, you obviously put up some really good numbers, once again, on credit quality and I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale non-performing assets quarter-to-quarter. Can you give us any color on what brought that down and could you tie in also any concerns that you may have about the energy portfolio. I know it's not material, but there is some concerns out there about energy credits.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nSure. So, on wholesale non-performing loans in the CIB. That was some name-specific upgrades that we had in the CIB. And then in the commercial bank that was related to charge-offs taken in the quarter. And then, on energy, really nothing there semantically, I would say like any sector we have upgrades and downgrades and this quarter was no exception. But I wouldn't say anything semantically in our portfolio that we're concerned about.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good. And then, I don't know if I heard you correctly on the last answer to the stock repurchase program. I understand of course it's driven by your CCAR results. But if the price of the stock, and that's a good problem to have, gets to a level that you consider to be too high.I think you may have said 2 times tangible book value, what then happens if the price, if it gets to a point where you guys think it's just too high to buy it back, what do you do with the excess capital at that point? Have you given that much -- and again, that's a good problem to have. I understand that. But have you given any thought to that?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, we give a lot of thought to it. And I agree, it is a high-class problem. And so, we said that at or above two times tangible book makes sense. If it continues to go up, we're going to continue to look at alternatives. Most importantly, within the Company in terms of how we should really think about the returns on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit differently in terms of organic growth. Jamie, I don't know if there is anything you want to add?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, you said it all.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorOur next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, good morning. So Jennifer, wanted to start with a question on capital. Quarles indicated in a recent interview that he plans to implement the bulk of the SEB in 2020 CCAR. Also alluded to the possibility of deploying a counter-cyclical buffer as part of that. I'm just wondering if the counter-cyclical buffer is actually deployed or incorporated within the test. Is that something that's underwritten as part of your 12% CET1 target and are you anticipating changes to the GSIB coefficient calculations that you alluded to earlier in the call as part of the coming cycle as well.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Steven. So, I mean, you touched on a number of things that are all important and I think what's most important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them. The comment from the Vice-Chair has been constructive in the sense that he always reiterate that he thinks the level of capital in the system is about right. And so we'll have a firmer view when we see a final rule. As you say, we do expect to see something in 2020 based upon the comments that we have heard, just like you have and we expect that our 12% target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the Vice Chair say over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right. And then, but we didn't have a firm view until we see the final rule.And then, on GSIB we remain hopeful that we're going to see the refinements that the Fed has been talking about, perhaps not full recalibration until Basel IV, which is what the Vice Chair recently said. But, certainly, there are a number of refinements that we've been talking about and the Fed has been talking about for year and that we remain hopeful that we'll see them very soon.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nThanks for that color. Jennifer. And just one final one from me. We saw really strong FIC results as well as really strong institutional deposit growth. I was hoping you could speak to what impact the Fed balance sheet growth is actually having on all of your different businesses or how that's manifesting, because it seems to be providing a pretty nice tailwind whether it's some increased activity as well as some benefit in terms of deposit growth that you're seeing across the overall franchise but institutional in particular.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So you're absolutely right. On the wholesale side, the Fed balance sheet extension was for sure a tailwind for us, although I would say, the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the wholesale side in the quarter was from strong organic growth in client acquisition [Technical issue] was a tailwind. And elsewhere I would say, obviously it was the right thing to do and provided stability in the repo markets throughout the quarter.Operator\n\n\n\n\nOur next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystHey, good morning. Quick question on the deposit costs, could you just break down maybe by segment where the big drivers were, that saw -- you saw have the big reduction in deposit costs linked-quarter. Was that in security services, was it the wealth management?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nSure. Sure, Brian. So on that, I'll start with retail where we saw rates paid tick up a bit and that's on migration from savings to CDs. We have seen CD pricing come off its peak, but continuing migration from savings to CDs. And then, on the wholesale side, you see bigger declines in rates paid in treasury services for sure and then a little bit less so in the commercial bank and AWM.And again, as we always say, these are name specific client by client decisions. And while we feel good about where we are, these are decisions we make client by client and we're certainly careful and have a lot of discipline not going to lose valuable relationships over a few ticks of beta.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystAnd then, a separate question. In the Commercial Bank, I mean you're seeing loans come down quarter-on-quarter for end of period and generally modest growth year-over-year. I mean what's the sentiment now in the middle market and the corporate client. Is it a sentiment issue? Is it just timing issue there for seeing better loan growth?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So there are obviously some puts and takes which I'll run through, but broadly speaking, I would say, what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand. And in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused, in specialized industries and market expansion, but of course, that's offset partially by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off. And then in CRE, good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunity there, given the rate environment and then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined, given where we are in the cycle.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would just add. When capital expenditures come down, all things being equal, which they're not, but all things being equal, you're going to see a reduction in some lendings as companies need less money to pay off receivables and inventory and plant and equipment.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorOur next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Glenn.\n\n\n\n\nGlenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHello there, hi. A quick question on open APIs and what the big picture is here and how it impacts you and the rest of the banking industry meaning there is concerns over data security and things like that, but JPMorgan has some -- plenty of agreements with some of the bigger providers. I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts on what level concern should we have and what's the good and the bad.Yeah. I mean there, I would say, Glenn, our customers' data privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. And we think over time the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have third-party apps only access data through our APIs. And so we are working name by name to get those agreements in place. And we hope, through time that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our customers' data. We think that's the most secure way to do it.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nBut very importantly, is that, that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them is not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off as opposed to today, if you gave you bank passcode to someone, they're taking your data every day, maybe even every minute and you don't even know about it because you forgot.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerGreat point. And we're going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nSo you will give them the tools to control that.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, you can imagine a dashboard, where they will have the...James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nThat is the full intent.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, just curious if you've seen any follow-on impacts that you've seen some repricing on parts of the illiquid markets and for specifically some of the unprofitable parts of those companies, and is that just the repricing and everybody that owns them will take some hits a little bit slower progress on banking front and that's it or is there anything bigger there to worry about with what's going on in the illiquid side.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAre you taking about the private companies?Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nYes, I am, sorry.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, look, there are a lot of private companies, lot of them do well, some don't, some have failed. Some have access to capital now and they wouldn't have access to capital in a downturn, but it's not a systemic issue. It's just -- in the capital market there are a lot of private companies and -- so I don't think it's that big a deal. You just have an adjustment in access to capital that will happen periodically.Operator\n\n\n\n\nOur next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- AnalystThank you. Jennifer, you were kind of foreshadowing lower tax rate as you kind of move into the first quarter and then the tax rate here in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected. Is there anything that's permanent here or are there some things that are just kind of rolling through these two quarters?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nYeah, there -- I wouldn't say there's anything permanent there. The first quarter is typically lower for us Marty. You can think about full-year '20 as been 20% plus or minus, and of course that would depend on any non-recurring items we might have or any change in regulation. But 20% plus or minus, and then of course that managed tax rate is typically 500 to 700 basis points higher than that.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- AnalystAnd then a bigger question, when we came into 2018, the net interest margin was around 2.5% and then now as we are coming out of 2019, the net interest margin has fallen below 2.4%. So interest rates went up a 100 basis points and then down 75 basis points and we've netted down a negative 10 basis points. So I was just curious on that path, it's either the way the Fed kind of inflected very quickly that created a little bit more pressure in the net between deposit pricing a loan pricing or do we think that this is probably just some of the competition that came in after the tax reform and maybe this is just the evidence of some of that competition with the increased profitability that we got from the benefit from the taxes?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nYeah. So there, I would say Marty, on that -- sort of the last several hikes, there were some catch-up there because we know we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment. So if you're just looking at the last few high, the betas would certainly be higher than what we're seeing in terms of the first three eases here. But broadly speaking on NIM, I mean we don't -- NIM is an outcome for us, not an input and as we think about looking forward, certainly the environment is very competitive, it always has been. And NII, the outlook for 2020 is, at this point, based upon the implied flat to slightly down and we do expect balance sheet growth.OperatorOur next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nHi, morning, thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you can give a bit more color on your markets performance there, obviously it's done very well. Geographically though, is there much more weighting there on the U.S. versus Europe and APAC.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerI would say Andrew that it was broad based. We can have Jason and team follow up specifically on a geographic breakdown. But, but it was -- it was largely broad based.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\nRight. And would you say with confidence that you're gaining market share in both territories there?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I don't have the split on market share by region, but Jason and team can certainly follow-up on that.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm not sure we want to start disclosing that regularly. But I do believe the market share went up in -- pretty much in most markets, but you can't say most markets in all products.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Operator\n\n\n\n\nAnd our next question is from Alison Williams of Bloomberg Intelligence.Alison Williams -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- AnalystGood morning. So I had a similar question, just circling back to trading and then CIB more broadly. So obviously, the bank has gained share, but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically, businesses like cash management, transaction banking and corporate clients in general. You're a leader in the U.S. Anecdotally we hear U.S. banks have been making gains in Europe. Can you speak at all to that opportunity.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\nSure. So as you said, we'll give you more color at Investor Day for the Treasury Services business. We feel really good about where we're positioned. I think going forward, there will obviously be some rate headwinds there, which we think can be offset by organic growth. But given the investments that we have made there, Jamie have mentioned InstaMed earlier. We feel really good about the capabilities that we're adding and what we're seeing in terms of organic growth there, but we can talk to you more about that at Investor Day.Alison Williams -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- AnalystOkay, thank you.Operator\n\n\n\n\nAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerOkay. Thanks everyone.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\nGuys, we'll see you. Thank you. I'll see you guys tomorrow.Jennifer A.

Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37, and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year on year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm wide results.The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year on year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year on year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year on year, driven by compensation including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.\n\n\n\n\n And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card, and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year on year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year on year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year on year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In-home lending, revenue was up 3% year on year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year on year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.\n\n\n\n\n And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year on year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year on year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year on year. Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year on year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.\n\n\n\n\n Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year on year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation, and growth in place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year on year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year on year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed-income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion.\n\n\n\n\n Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year on year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year on year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year on year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on Page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth-quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense. And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues. But we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. \n\n\n\n\n Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question.\n\n\n\n\n I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for '25? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve. So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit.\n\n\n\n\n So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter. And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth. Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.\n\n\n\n\nJim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst All right. Thanks a lot.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorThank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.Steven Chubak -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. So, Jeremy, hi. How are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light.\n\n\n\n\n I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion.\n\n\n\n\n So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management. We're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things.\n\n\n\n\n And also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time.Steven Chubak -- Analyst No. Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer More than 6%. So like --\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.Steven Chubak -- Analyst Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Steve.OperatorThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Analyst My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year over year in '25, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year over year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness, or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Right, OK. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year. So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth-quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now --\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Could I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Good. OK. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there. So as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front-end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Analyst And if I can ask my second question and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n OK. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, etc. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.\n\n\n\n\n The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine. And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.Erika Najarian -- Analyst Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\n\n\n\n\nGlenn Schorr -- Analyst Hi. Thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed-income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical. I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid off, some are done.\n\n\n\n\n So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different.\n\n\n\n\n That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.Glenn Schorr -- Analyst All right. Thanks for all that.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as vice chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr's speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n But Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product.\n\n\n\n\n I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you.Operator\n\n\n\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi, and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n I noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year over year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Got it. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2nd, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer I think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy.\n\n\n\n\n So -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job.Mike Mayo -- Analyst So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n I think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I'm not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.Mike Mayo -- Analyst Let me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued.\n\n\n\n\n And on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Well, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices.\n\n\n\n\n And I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed-income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech's. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.\n\n\n\n\n Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Can I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well-positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers, and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet. But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit. But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it.\n\n\n\n\n We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that. And so far, we have.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Got it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September.\n\n\n\n\n Just give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a systemwide deposit growth, which gets removed.\n\n\n\n\n And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time.\n\n\n\n\n I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, both.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Hello. Hi. Good morning.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Can you hear me? Hello?\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yes. We can hear you. Yes.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Can you hear me OK?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. We can hear you. Can you hear us?Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it.\n\n\n\n\n But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR.\n\n\n\n\n But for the [Inaudible] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Those were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year on year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst OK. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n What about --James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer -- creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in a cautious category and credit card by the way, we are -- we don't like stretch.\n\n\n\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst I'm just wondering about the private-label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Almost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label.\n\n\n\n\n I know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible. So I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Thank you so much.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorThank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.Saul Martinez -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going.\n\n\n\n\n So I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high.\n\n\n\n\n And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Absolutely. Agree.\n\n\n\n\nSaul Martinez -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time.\n\n\n\n\n We're very comfortable, very nice business for you all.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Got it. OK, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Thanks, Saul.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, everyone.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\'s fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase\'s website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\'s chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. The firm reported revenue of 43.7 billion, up 3.8 billion or 10% year on year. NII ex-markets was down 548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances. NIR ex-markets was up 3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year\'s net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees.And markets revenue was up 1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of 22.8 billion were down 1.7 billion or 7% year on year. Excluding the prior year\'s FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation, as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.4 billion and a net reserve of 267 million.\n\n\n\n\n On Page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year. I\'ll remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of 54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of 173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and securities services. And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of 234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The 24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now, let\'s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. CCB reported net income of 4.5 billion on revenue of 18.4 billion, which was up 1% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 7% year on year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year on year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In home lending, revenue was up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue.\n\n\n\n\n Turning to card services and auto. Revenue was up 14% year on year, largely driven by card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolve growth. And in auto, originations were 10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of 9.7 billion were up 4% year on year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.1 billion, up 428 million year on year, driven by card. The net reserve build was 557 million, predominantly driven by higher card revolving balances. Next, the commercial and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of 6.6 billion on revenue of 17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41% and benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was 4.7 billion, up 3% year on year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was 1.9 billion, up 9% year on year, predominantly driven by lower losses on hedges.\n\n\n\n\n Moving to markets. Total revenue was 7 billion, up 21% year on year. Fixed income was up 20%, with better performance in credit, as well as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity in derivatives amid increased volatility and higher trading volumes in cash. Securities services revenue was 1.3 billion, up 10% year on year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of 8.7 billion were up 7% year on year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. Global corporate and investment banking loans were down 2% quarter on quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In commercial banking, middle market loans were also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. And commercial real estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year on year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were 61 million, driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, offset -- largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then to complete our lines of business, asset and wealth management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of 1.5 billion, with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of 5.8 billion was up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of 3.8 billion were up 11% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees.\n\n\n\n\n Long-term net inflows were 76 billion for the quarter, positive across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of 94 billion for the quarter and 104 billion for the full year -- 140 billion for the full year, sorry. And we had client asset net inflows of 468 billion for the year. AUM of 4 trillion and client assets of 5.9 trillion were both up 18% year on year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 5% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of 1.3 billion. Revenue of 2 billion was up 223 million year on year. NII of 2 billion was down 415 million year on year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a net loss of 30 million, compared with a net loss of 668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of 550 million were down 3 billion year on year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of 2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let\'s pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on Page 9. We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately 90 billion. Going through the drivers. As usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. It\'s worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 2024.\n\n\n\n\n You can see on the page that we\'ve illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth. We expect healthy card loan growth again this year but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits. Firmwide deposits have stabilized, and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025. It\'s notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth, as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect firmwide NII to be approximately 94 billion as a function of markets NII increasing to about 4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let\'s turn to expenses on Page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about 95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I\'ll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you\'ll note are very consistent with what you\'ve been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume- and revenue-related expense, which is primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers and advisors to support business growth, as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven as we continue to invest in new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization.\n\n\n\n\n Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our card business. And finally, while we haven\'t explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure; and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now, let\'s turn to Page 11 to cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we expect the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net income, and we\'re proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it\'s important to acknowledge the tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios. Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don\'t expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we\'re keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees. We are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees, as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I\'ll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A. James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Good morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it\'s premature what I\'m about to do. But I just want to say I\'d be -- and I\'d be remiss not to say that he\'s a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading, and then became a co-head of the investment bank and the sole head of the investment bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, you know, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world. And so -- and then, obviously, was the president for five years or more, a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So, we\'re thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Great. All right. So, let\'s go to questions.\n\n\n\n\n Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess what\'s the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus, you know, your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer So, John, read your theme the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer So, yeah, you\'ve noted all the points that we always make, so I won\'t repeat them. And I think the way we\'re thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have, you know, a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there\'s a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it, you know, at better levels, essentially, in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so, that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, you know, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates that you would expect, we\'ve concluded that we do have enough -- you know, we have enough excess. And given that, you know, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we\'re producing, it means that unless we find in the near-term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although I\'ll give the caveat that, as you know, it\'s in our disclosure, which is we don\'t want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n OK. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or the last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you\'ve talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing, that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high-certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. You know, the execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities. You know, in the commercial and investment bank, we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significant -- significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. You know, Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that\'s embedded in the culture of the company. So, we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But broadly, the themes are very consistent.\n\n\n\n\n I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is when we think about efficiency and how we\'ve generated at this company, it\'s organic, it\'s BAU, it\'s evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so, that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have, you know, a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, in technology, for starters, we\'re putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development. And there\'s been a lot of focus on that, the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive. And so, all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization, and so that\'s embedded in there as well. And another thing that\'s worth noting, you\'ll recall that at Investor Day, excuse me, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. Now, as Jamie always says, we\'re always modernizing. So, the fact that we\'ve gotten to a peak and that it might come down a little bit from here still means we\'re going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there\'s a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also, in some sense, a form of efficiency. Finally, though, what I would say is that, you know, if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot, and it\'s been for very good reasons, and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth, as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So, we\'re going to try to run things with some important exceptions that I\'ll highlight in a second on roughly flat headcount and have that lead to people generating, you know, internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things.\n\n\n\n\n The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high-certainty investment and growth, so obviously branches and bankers and so on; and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we\'re running the company safely. So, that\'s how we\'re thinking about efficiency in the current moment.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Very helpful. Thank you.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n [Inaudible] said.OperatorThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who\'s your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, you know, how -- why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I\'m hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you\'re going to stay less than five years? You\'re finally getting what you wanted, all 15 years of your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and the regulatory costs. And it seems like you\'re finally getting what you\'ve been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so, and what would you do otherwise anyway? You don\'t play golf. You aren\'t going to be Treasury secretary. It seems like your work is your hobby, right? So, how much longer would you stay around?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we\'re on a path. The path is not just about me.\n\n\n\n\n It\'s about the other senior people at the company. It\'s about the board. If I\'m here for several more years -- and, you know, I may or may not be chairman of that, it\'s going to be up to the board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? Now, you\'re talking potentially four or five years or more. I\'m 60 -- I\'ll be 69 in March. I think it\'s the rational thing to do. I\'ve had a couple of health problems you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense. And so -- and what was your first question again?Mike Mayo -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Who\'s your successor? I mean [Inaudible]James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You look -- you, guys -- I mean, this is -- look, this is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where, you know, these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and all the toing and froing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There may be one or two you don\'t know. The board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it\'s wonderful that Jen Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as chief operating officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she\'s willing to work with those people, which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership.\n\n\n\n\n And it\'ll be one of those people. And, you know, obviously, we\'re not going to tell the press, but it\'s not determined yet. And, you know, of course, at the last minute, you know, a couple of years from now, people get sick, they change their mind, they have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn\'t be completely sure.Mike Mayo -- Analyst So, you\'ll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yup. Basic case, yeah.Mike Mayo -- Analyst All right. Thank you.Operator\n\n\n\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, you know, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new soon-to-be -- I guess a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about again what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Jim. I mean, it\'s obviously something worth thinking about a lot, but, you know, I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don\'t really think that\'s productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, you know, if you read Jamie\'s quotes, they\'re very consistent with what we\'ve been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy, that isn\'t reflexively anti-bank, that doesn\'t default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity. It uses data, and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of the safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth. And the hope is that, you know, we get some of that. And that also, while we\'re at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get, you know, a little bit less bureaucratic and a little bit less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that, you know, at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether a capital goes up, down, stays flat, it\'s really so complicated because it\'s not just Basel III Endgame. It\'s also G-SIB. It\'s also a number of other factors. And that\'s why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly, with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer That\'s great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There\'s been a lot of recognition that what counts with liquidity and discount windows and how LCR has done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what do you want out of the banking system? And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, balkanized system we built, which has negatives. And even the regulators will tell you that. So, you know, at one point, just take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let\'s do the right thing, have -- and continue to have the best financial system in the world.\n\n\n\n\nJim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Yup. That makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth, have you -- since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it\'s a good question, and I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don\'t particularly think that\'s a negative. I think it\'s probably explained by a combination of wide open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets, you know, and healthy balance sheets and small businesses and maybe some residual caution.\n\n\n\n\n And maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they\'re executing in the near term. But we\'ll see what the new year brings as, you know, the current optimism starts getting tested with reality one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you\'ll actually see that come through C&I loan growth, in particular.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks.Operator\n\n\n\n\nThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.Erika Najarian -- Analyst Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that -- you know, somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50 basis points, you know, two years and one day from now. At the same time, you know, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks in terms of the transparency. You know, it\'s -- it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year\'s stress test.\n\n\n\n\n So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7 is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of, you know, two big components? Clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right, Erika. OK. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. Let\'s try to address this not at too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter to fourth quarter. So, while our current view of the G-SIB number is an estimate, we\'re quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket, just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types.\n\n\n\n\n So, that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal pattern. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, you know, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it\'s not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But anyway, for now, we\'re managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. OK. You mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that, you know, we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we\'ve been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the, you know, non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that\'s great. I think -- you know, I won\'t speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let\'s just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you\'re really asking me is what is our core view about -- and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment? And the way we\'re increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5 numerator, up 10 numerator, up 20 numerator -- I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less -- and then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And, you know, as you point out, at 15.7, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like 275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it\'s a ton of excess, which is why we\'ve concluded that it doesn\'t need to grow anymore.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Analyst And just as a follow-up question -- follow-up to John\'s line of questioning, as a placeholder, as we think about what you said trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that, you know, anything that you don\'t need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7 will be bought back, you know, buy the company as we think about -- I know you don\'t want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, you\'ve quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer But we are never going to tell the market what we\'re going to do. I mean, you all know that everyone is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake.OperatorDoes that conclude your question, Erika?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yup.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. OK.\n\n\n\n\nMatthew O\'Connor -- Analyst Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you\'re materially overearning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that\'s expected now or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically in the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we\'ve seen?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It\'s a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple of different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you\'re right.\n\n\n\n\n If you look at the NII guidance that we\'re giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve playing out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won\'t happen, but, you know, if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we\'re sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And, you know, you could draw the conclusion that that means that, you know, the overall earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that, in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field. The current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being, anyway, you know, when we do the math, that\'s what we see. Do we think that\'s truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess, you know, we\'ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer We\'ve gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it is worth noting that, you know, NII ex-markets is down year on year, so there\'s some amount of normalization coming.Matthew O\'Connor -- Analyst OK. And then just separately, a strategic question, there\'s been some reports about you further expanding the consumer banking business globally, and I guess I just want to, you know, push on that where, you know, we really haven\'t seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I\'m just wondering, like, you know, is it worth it.\n\n\n\n\n Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risks of doing global consumer banking?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think you\'ve kind of answered your own question in the sense, like, you know, we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative, and I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. And that\'s not to say that, like, we\'re special or anything. It\'s just that the strategy is very different and it\'s a very different moment. So, you know, it\'s a new initiative. It\'s obviously not risk-free, but it\'s going pretty well. And, you know -- but pointing out the obvious, if we didn\'t think it was worth it, we wouldn\'t be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.\n\n\n\n\n And it\'s one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively, you know, through all of our management processes.Matthew O\'Connor -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Operator\n\n\n\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Hi. Good morning.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Hey, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Can you hear me OK? All right. I just want to make sure you can hear me. So, this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It\'s been a great call, with a lot of robust questions here. You\'re, like, what else is there to ask? Here\'s my question. As we think about the NII outlook, and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan -- but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to the -- could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, you know, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around, you know, you\'ve got the green market share No. 1, you\'ve got the yellow, you\'ve got the red places maybe we can\'t see, could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are -- you know, where they are? Are they just scattered? Everybody\'s -- every single business has one.\n\n\n\n\n Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee generative? That\'s kind of what I\'d like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think -- you know, looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of frankly that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company\'s performance would be acquisition finance because that\'s been relatively muted as a function of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there. Now, that\'s -- those aren\'t loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long. So, you know, whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue. But as we -- as you can see, like, in our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, you know, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be -- it\'s decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n It\'s still growing above trend obviously, which is great and it\'s a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we\'re getting from our card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know, you know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind, you know, in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism. Could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes, but I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we\'ll see. We\'ll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right, and they\'re aligned with our big, long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in, you know, the -- what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space. We are significantly underpenetrated relative to, you know, the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that\'s why we\'re pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but, you know, we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business, inside investment banking, and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great, in any given region, in any given subsector, we can do better. And as I mentioned, you know, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.\n\n\n\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Analyst Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Betsy.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Good morning. I guess just two questions in terms of areas of vulnerability. So, I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents, like if we anchor to the fact that the administration that\'s taking place are going to take office with a focus on domestic capex. Even if we don\'t get any rate cuts, when you look through your customer base, where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, we\'d love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, I see what your question is. That took me a second. Yeah. I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You know, you obviously know that we -- we\'re coming out of a 10-plus-year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate. And so, at some point, that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, to -- a little bit to Jamie\'s comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio -- of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you know, you can rest assured that we\'re running the relevant analysis, but I\'m not inclined to, you know, go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?\n\n\n\n\nJames Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I just want to add, the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment that\'s both on the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, subprime, credit card. So, really, it\'s your forecast of unemployment, you\'re going to have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said is vulnerabilities. You know, it\'s unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. You know, I\'m not -- we\'re not predicting that, but you just ask where the vulnerability is. That\'s the vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst And I guess -- thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I\'m just wondering if you have any thoughts there on how -- when the Fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit growth?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I\'m not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete; and therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H8 data and our kind of flow-of-funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our ARPU is behaving, evolution of QT expectations for, you know, economywide loan growth, etc., and what the impact of that might be on the growth of systemwide deposits, it\'s kind of consistent with the story that we\'re telling about our sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, you know, plus or minus what happens with the policy rate, and, you know, stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.\n\n\n\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Good. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our final question is -- comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\n\n\n\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy, you mentioned --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Gerard.\n\n\n\n\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst You mentioned in your comments about the overall firmwide deposits have stabilized; and in second half, you could see some growth and you\'ve already -- I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running at about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you -- based on what you\'re seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer That\'s fascinating, Gerard. I\'ll have to take a look at that data. I don\'t actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it\'s a couple of things.\n\n\n\n\n So, of course, there was some excess and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So, you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we\'re in the final innings of that. We\'re just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring a lot of new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So, you know, the combination of the tail end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in these sort of organic build-out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share with us the pros and cons from JPMorgan\'s perspective, not so much from an investor? But we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital.\n\n\n\n\n But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You\'re growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan\'s perspective?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, Jamie, he made some public comments on this at a conference some time back, so he\'ll -- if he wants to go. So, go ahead.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Go ahead. Jeremy, go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No, seriously.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n I was just going to say we\'re not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know. But most people don\'t want it. It doesn\'t enhance shareholder value. And I -- I\'ve never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it\'s a huge mistake to look at life like you have to "deploy capital." So, we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special, they really basically don\'t work.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very well.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer If anyone has a different opinion, you know, we\'re always interested.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Gerard.OperatorThank you. And we have no further questions at this time.\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you very much.

We are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. It's slightly longer this quarter, given we're not having Investor Day. And so, after I review our results I'll spend some time on our outlook for 2021 as well as touch on a few important balance sheet topics that are top of mind for us. So, starting on Page 1 for the fourth quarter, the firm reported net income of $12.1 billion, EPS of $3.79 on revenue of $13.2 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 24%. Included in these results are approximately $3 billion of credit reserve releases. Before we get into more detail on our performance, I'll just touch on a few highlights.First off, our customers and clients continue to demonstrate strong financial resilience in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as evidenced in our credit metrics thus far. We saw continued momentum in investment banking and grew our share to 9.2%. In CIB markets, revenue was up 20% year on year, driven by strong client activity and elevated volatility in the quarter. And in AWM, we had record revenue of 10% year on year.\n\n\n\n\n On deposits, we saw another quarter of strong growth up 35% year on year, and 6% sequentially. And Fed balance sheet expansion continued to increase the overall amount of cash in the system while loan growth remains muted at 1% growth year on year and quarter on quarter. On to Page 2 for more on our fourth-quarter results. Revenue of $30.2 billion was up $1 billion, or 3% year on year. Net interest income was down approximately $900 million, or 7%, primarily driven by lower rates and mix, partly offset by balance sheet growth and higher markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion, or 13% on higher IB fees, legacy investment gains in corporate, and higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $16 million were down 2% year on year on lower volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by continued investments. Credit costs were a net benefit of $1.9 billion down $3.3 billion year on year, primarily driven by reserve releases of $2.9 billion that I'll cover in more detail shortly. Turning to the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $29.1 billion, EPS of $8.88 on record revenue of nearly $123 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Revenue was up $4.5 billion, or 4% year on year as net interest income was down $2.8 billion, or 5% on lower rates partly offset by higher markets NII and balance sheet growth. And noninterest revenue was up $7.3 billion, or 12% on higher markets and IB fees as well as higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $56.7 billion were up 2% year on year, driven by volume and revenue-related expenses, higher legal and continued investments, partially offset by lower structural expenses. And credit costs were $17.5 billion, reflecting a net reserve build of $12.2 billion due to the impacts of COVID-19 and net charge-offs that were down year on year. Now turning to reserves on Page 4. We released approximately $3 billion of reserves this quarter across wholesale and home lending.\n\n\n\n\n Starting with wholesale, we released $2 billion due to improving macroeconomic scenarios and the continued ability of our clients to access capital markets and liquidity. In home lending, we released $900 million, primarily on improvement in HPI expectations, and to a lesser extent, portfolio run-off. And in card, we held reserves flat as we remained cautious about the near term, especially with the number of unemployed still nearly two times pre-pandemic levels and potential payment shock coming to consumers from expiring benefits. And so with the near-term outlook still quite uncertain, we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios. And at nearly $31 billion, we are reserved at approximately $9 billion above the current base case. And to touch on net charge-offs for the quarter, they were down about $450 million year on year and remained relatively low across our portfolios. Looking forward, we still don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021. And with the recent stimulus, it could be even later. Turning to Page 5. We've included here an update on our customer assistance programs, and you can see the trends are largely similar to last quarter and further evidence of the resilience of our customers. The vast majority of what's left in deferral is in mortgage with $10 billion of own loans and $13 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we're seeing from our customers that have exited relief, more than 90% of accounts remained current. Turning to balance sheet and capital on Page 6. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat versus the prior quarter on strong earnings generation, largely offset by dividends of $2.8 billion and higher RWA. As we stated in our press release last month, the board has authorized share repurchases and we plan to resume buybacks in the first quarter up to our Fed authorized capacity of $4.5 billion after paying our $0.90 dividend. You can see here on the page, we've included the liquidity coverage ratio for both the firm and the bank, which we believe is important to look at together in order to better understand the liquidity profile of our balance sheet.\n\n\n\n\n The firm is at a healthy LCR of 110%. However, the bank LCR is 160%, reflecting the extraordinary deposit growth that has meaningfully outpaced loan demand. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 7. In the fourth quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32%. Revenue of $12.7 billion was down 8% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue. Deposit growth was 30% year on year, up over $200 billion as balances remain elevated and as we continue to acquire new customers and deepening primary relationships. Loans were down 6% year on year with home lending down due to portfolio run-off and card down on lower spend, offset by business banking, which was up due to PPP loans. Client investment assets were up 17% year on year, driven by both net inflows and market performance. On spend, combined debit and credit card sales volume in the quarter was up 1% year on year, which reflected debit sales of 12%, largely driven by retail and everyday spend and credit sales down 4%, largely driven by T&E. In home lending, overall production margins remained strong. Total originations were down 2% year on year but were up 12% quarter on quarter, both driven by correspondent and we lean into the minister channel after pulling back earlier in the year. For the year, total originations were $114 billion, including nearly $73 billion of consumer originations, both the highest since 2013. In auto, loan and lease origination volume was $11 billion, up 29% year on year. And across the franchise, digital engagement continues to accelerate. Our customers use quick deposit for more than 40% of all check deposits, which is nearly 10 percentage points higher than a year ago. And in home lending, nearly two-thirds of our consumer applications were completed digitally using Chase My Home, and that has tripled since the first quarter.\n\n\n\n\n Over 69% -- overall, 69% of our customers are digitally active with business banking at 86%, both higher than a year ago. Expenses of $7 billion were down 1% year on year and credit costs were a net benefit of $83 million, driven by $900 million of reserve releases in home lending, largely offset by net charge-offs in card of $767 million. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 8. CIB reported net income of $5.3 billion and an ROE of 26% on revenue of $11.4 billion for the fourth quarter and an ROE of 20% on revenue of $49 billion for the full year. The extraordinary nature of this year has meant that we had records in almost every category for both the quarter and the full year. In investment banking, IB fees were up 25% for the year and we grew share to its highest level in a decade. In the quarter, investment banking revenue of $2.5 billion was up 37% year on year, and up 20% sequentially. The quarter's performance was driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance market as well as strong performances in DCM and M&A. In advisory, we were up 19% year on year, driven by the closing of several large transactions. The M&A market continued to strengthen this quarter, and in fact, announced volumes exceeded pre-COVID levels. Debt underwriting fees were up 23% year on year, driven by leverage finance activity and we maintained our number one rank overall. In equity underwriting, fees were up 88% year on year, primarily driven by a strong performance in follow-ons and IPOs. Looking forward, we expect IB fees to be up modestly for the first quarter and the overall pipeline remains robust. We expect M&A to remain active on improved overall CEO confidence and the momentum in equity capital markets is expected to continue, of course dependent on a successful containment of COVID. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5.9 billion, up 20% year on year against the record fourth quarter last year.\n\n\n\n\n Fixed income was up 15% year on year, driven by good client activity across businesses, particularly in spread products as well as the favorable trading environment in currencies and emerging markets, credit, and commodities. Equities was up 32% year on year, driven by strong client activity and equity derivative and cash throughout the quarter across both flow trading and large episodic transactions. Looking forward, we expect markets to remain active in the first quarter and we have seen strong performance since the start of January, but it's obviously too early to predict the full quarter. And for the remaining quarters of this year and the full year, the comparison will be particularly challenging given the extraordinary performance of markets in 2020. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year on year, primarily reflecting the reporting reclass in merchant services. And securities services revenue of $1.1 billion was down 1% year on year. On a full-year basis, a headwind from lower rates were almost entirely offset by robust deposit growth. Expenses of $4.9 billion were down 9% compared to the prior year, driven by lower compensation and legal expenses. Now let's go to commercial banking on Page 9. Commercial banking reported net income of $2 billion and an ROE of 36%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 7% year on year with higher lending and investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Record growth investment banking revenue of $971 million was up 53% year on year. And the full year was also a record, finishing at $3.3 billion, surpassing our previously established $3 billion long-term target. And given our investments in bank coverage, we believe there is continued upside from here. Expenses of $950 million were flat year on year. Deposits of $277 billion were up 52% year on year, and 11% quarter on quarter as client balances remain elevated.\n\n\n\n\n Average loans were up 1% year on year, but down 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% on our revolver balances with utilization rates nearing record lows as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity. And CRE loans were down 1% on higher prepayment activity in both CTL and real estate banking. Finally, credit cards were a net benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by reserve releases. Now on to asset and wealth management on Page 10. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $786 million with a pre-tax margin and ROE of 29%. And for the year, AWM generated record net income of $3 billion with pre-tax margin and ROE of 28%. For the quarter, revenue of $3.9 billion was up 10% year on year as higher performance and management fees, as well as growth in deposit and low balances, were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were up 13% year on year, primarily due to higher legal expenses related to the resolution of matters previously announced. But excluding this, expenses would have been up 4% year on year on volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $33 billion, positive across all channels, asset classes and regions. And this was true of the $92 billion for the full year as well. In liquidity, we saw net outflows of $36 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $104 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.7 trillion, up 17% and 18% year on year respectively were driven by net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 31% year on year and loans were up 15% as clients continue to increase our liquidity and look for investment opportunities. Now on to corporate on Page 11.\n\n\n\n\n Corporate reported net loss of $358 million. Revenue was the loss of approximately $250 million, relatively flat year on year. Net interest income was down $730 million on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities as well as limited deployment opportunity on the back of continued deposit growth. The declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately $540 million on several legacy equity investments. And expenses of $361 million were roughly flat year on year as well. Now shifting gears, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021, which I'll cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 12. As you can see on the page, we expect NII to be around $55.5 billion in 2021, and this is based on the latest implies, which reflects this deepening yield curve we've seen over the past few weeks. As you can see that we do expect to be able to more than offset the impact of low rates in 2021 from continued deposit growth and higher markets NII. But it's important to note that it takes the loan growth to truly realize the benefits of a steeper yield curve.I'll also just remind you that the increase in CIB markets NII is largely offset in NIR, and this component is highly market dependent. And so as it relates to loan growth, while there should be some opportunities in AWM in wholesale, we expect headwinds, at least in the near term as corporate cash balances are at all-time high, card payment rates are elevated and there continues to be significant prepayments in home lending. But we do expect these to normalize and see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year, particularly in cards. Therefore, our fourth quarter 2021 NII estimate of $14 billion or more is a reasonable exit rate. And notably, that's in the zipcode of our 4Q '19 NII when rates were significantly higher than they are today. We've also included on the right side of page some risks and opportunities, and obviously, this isn't an exhaustive list, but are the drivers that could be most impactful to this year's NII outlook. Now turning to expenses on Page 13. As Jamie mentioned last month, we do expect our expenses to increase in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n And based on our latest work, we expect that number to be around $68 billion, up versus the prior guidance of $67 billion, largely due to higher volume and revenue-related expenses and the impact of FX, both of which have offsets in the revenue line as well as the impact of expenses from our recent acquisition of cxLoyalty. Then taking a look at the year-over-year expense growth, you can see it's primarily due to investments, which I'll cover in more detail on the next page. Our volume and revenue-related expenses are up slightly with some puts and takes there. That's obviously market dependent, but remember, any changes there do come with corresponding changes to our top-line. And in structural, we expect a net reduction of approximately $200 million. Notably, this includes a decrease of $500 million, reflecting the realization of continued cost efficiencies and what largely our fixed cost base. And you can see that it is partially offset by the impact of FX on our non-U.S. dollar expenses. It's important to note that while structural is coming down, it doesn't represent the full extent of our productivity, we're realizing efficiencies in each category here. For example, our software engineers are becoming more productive and we are reducing our cost to serve as we're seeing more customers use our digital tools to self-serve. Moving to Page 14 to take a closer look at our investment spend. Over the past few years, our investment spend has been around $10 billion and we expect that to increase to nearly $12.5 billion in 2021. You can see that we've highlighted on the page the major areas of focus that we've been consistently investing in for years, which should continue to strengthen our franchise and drive revenue growth. Starting on the bottom with technology, this represents roughly half of the overall investment spend. And these tech investments are across the board as we look to better meet our customer and client needs, improve our customers' digital experience, strengthen our fraud detection capabilities as well as modernize and improve our technology infrastructure cloud and data capabilities. Moving to nontech investments.\n\n\n\n\n We expect marketing spend, largely CCB, to return to pre-COVID levels this year after being down in 2020. We continue to invest in our distribution capabilities across all of our businesses. This includes hiring bankers and advisors, not only in U.S., but also internationally as well as expanding our physical footprint. We've been continuing to execute against our branch expansion plans in new markets, having opened 170 branches so far out of our planned 400, and expect to be in all contiguous 48 states by new 2021. Jamie is laughing. And the other bucket on the page is a catchall for everything else, including real estate and other various investments across our businesses. These expenses were very stable the past few years and the increase in 2021 is largely related to our $30 billion commitment to the path forward, which includes promoting affordable housing, expanding homeownership for underserved communities and supporting minority-owned businesses, and then as well as expenses related to our acquisition of cxLoyalty. So in summary, you can see that we continue to invest through the cycle. And it's these investments that we believe position us well to outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment. Now I will turn to a few balance sheet and capital-related topics, starting on Page 15. Over the next few slides, I'd like to provide you some insight on how recent monetary expansion and corresponding growth in the financial system is creating new challenges for bank balance sheet. More specifically, this expansion is putting significant pressure on size-based capital requirements, which is likely to impact business decisions, including capital targets.We'll start with what has happened this year. In response to the COVID crisis, the Fed's balance sheet has significantly expanded, which has resulted in $3 trillion of domestic deposit growth across the U.S. commercial banks. What's important to note is that this QE is unlike anything we've seen before. In the current QE, we have experienced a much bigger and faster expansion.\n\n\n\n\n And that expansion has come without meaningful loan demand beyond PPP, as you can see in the loan-to-deposit ratio on the page. This has resulted in bank balance sheets, which are larger, but more liquid and less risky.From a bank capital perspective, the key question to ask is, how long will this persist. On the chart, you can see that the QE3 online kept the Fed on pause for several years before a modest pace of reductions. So even if the Fed immediately signals tapering, which of course is not the base case and follows the pace of the last online, it will take many years to return to pre-COVID levels. Of course, the online speed [Inaudible], but I think we can all agree that bank balance sheets will remain elevated for some time. Now let's go to Page 16 and see how this will impact capital going forward. Few factors that are top of mind for us are GSIB, which we've been talking about for a long time, and also SLR which is not something we typically talk about, but given the overall system expansion is now on focus. On the graph, what you can see here are the historical trends of GSIB and SLR base requirements, overlaid with the path of the Fed securities holdings. You can see that during the original calibration of these rules, which included significant gold plating, the Fed balance sheet was notably lower. With the recent growth in the Fed balance sheet, we are seeing upward pressure in increases to GSIB requirements as well as the SLR shifting from a backstop to a binding measure, which will impact the pace of capital return, and these dynamics will likely persist for an extended period. The Fed temporary relief of SLR expires after March 31. This adjustment for cash and treasuries should either be made permanent or at a minimum be extended. With these exclusions, you can see how this remains a backstop measure, not a binding one. And on GSIB, there has been public dialog about the need to index the score to GDP as a proxy to account for ordinary economic expansion over time. And this was also cited by the Fed as a possible shortcoming of their framework. For 2020, GDP was clearly not the best proxy for system expansion but the principle still applies.\n\n\n\n\n GSIB was designed as a relative measure between large and medium-sized banks. And therefore, it certainly reflects an overall system expansion, which impacted small, medium and large banks alike. By future-proofing GSIB at inception with the adjustments outlined on the page, you can see the resulting GSIB score profile, lowered over time, but more importantly, flatter over the course of the most recent system expansion. While we recognize that prudent bank capital requirements do promote safety and soundness, satisfying these heightened requirements is certainly not costless which is why these two areas, GSIB and leverage are top of mind for us in 2021. Now let's look at the impact of this on marginal deposits on Page 17. In addition to what we've already discussed, there are two more building blocks required to see the full picture of marginal deposit economics, and they are interest rates and loan demand. We've experienced a combination of both lower interest rates and lower loan demand, which have reduced the NIM of marginal deposits to practically zero, which you can see here on the chart. And this is an issue for all banks, not just GSIBs or JPMorgan. However, what is specific to the larger banks is that when the SLR becomes binding, we may be required to issue new debt and retain higher equity, which ultimately makes the marginal deposit a negative ROE proposition in today's ultra-low rate environment. The key test and question is, what could happen next? We could simply shy away from taking new deposits, redirecting them elsewhere in the system or we can issue or retain additional capital and pass on some of their costs, which is certainly something we wouldn't want to do in this environment. And therefore, we strongly encourage a serious look to these sized-based capital calibrations with an appropriate sense of urgency as we will soon be facing this critical business decision. All of this can be addressed through a few simple adjustments, namely, an extension of the SLR exclusion and GSIB fixed as we've spoken about overtime. But to be clear, we believe the framework as a whole has made the banking system safer as we experienced in 2020. But we're also seeing evidence where the lack of coherence and recalibration is risking unintended consequences going forward. With all that said, before I close things out on capital, here is how we're thinking about target CET1 levels. While GSIB pressure remains and the need for recalibration is high, our SCB optimization can provide some offset, allowing us to manage to a 12% CET1 target.\n\n\n\n\n The recent stress test showed an implied 20 basis point reduction to SCB, and we have continued our optimization efforts since the resubmission. So we're hopeful for a lower SCB later this year, of course, that's scenario dependents. At this point, it's too early to provide specific color on the impact of SLR, so it's just important to know that in the absence of any adjustments to the measure, we may have to issue preferreds or carry additional fee if you want over the 12% target I just mentioned. We obviously can't emphasize these key messages enough and these factors are clearly front and center as we think about managing our balance sheet and capital targets in the near and medium term. Now before we conclude, note that we've included a few additional slides on our businesses and the intent is to give you an update on their strategic highlights our performance as well as provide the latest financial outlook. The themes and initiatives we talked about at last year's Investor Day still remain our focus and we continue to execute and make progress against them.So to wrap up, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year, but it also showcased the benefits of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company, while our employees relentlessly focused on supporting our customers, clients, and communities. While downside risk do remain in the near term and it could be significant, several recent factors help us feel more optimistic as we look ahead to the recovery in the medium and longer term. So with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: OperatorCertainly. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\n\n\n\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jen. And happy New Year.\xa0Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Happy New Year, Steve.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst So, I want to start off with a question on the NII outlook. The 2021 guide implies rather a healthy step up versus the $54 billion. Jamie, you had reiterated just last month in your updated NII guide for '21. What are you assuming regarding the deployment of excess liquidity given some of the recent curves deepening? And separately, what are your assumptions around the trajectory for card balances and overall growth in '21, especially in light of the expectations for additional stimulus which we saw at least this past year could drive further consumer deleveraging?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, I'll start with excess liquidity. So, I think their -- the theme is we're being opportunistic or patient. So, as you think about the recent moves that we've seen in the yield curve, in the grand scheme of things, those could be small moves and, you know, as we think about managing the balance sheet it's not just about an eye, of course, it's about capital. And so there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further sell-off.\xa0So, we're -- we're being very patient but we have been and will continue to be optimistic and you will have seen that we did add $60 billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter. So, that's what we're assuming and the outlook is -- is, you know, a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity. And then --\xa0Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n In the implied terms.\xa0Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. In the implied terms, yeah. And then on current balances, it is quite extraordinary what we're seeing in terms of payment rates in the current portfolio which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to be leveraged. So, there is an offset in the credit line but we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of 2021 as I spend recovers but that it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated. So, that's why everything listed on that page is a plus/minus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And just for my follow up, I wanted to ask on capital. Both the slides are really interesting highlighting the impact of QE on the leverage ratio and GSIB scores. You've been critical of GSIB surcharges and the need to recalibrate these coefficients for some time. We haven't really seen much progress there. It kind of feels like waiting for Godot as if the Fed is slow to recalibrate the minimum leverage ratios to account for this QE-driven deposit growth. What mitigating actions can you take to ensure you're not capital-constrained as balance sheet growth continues and maybe any revenue attrition we need to contemplate as part of those mitigating actions?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Sure. So -- so, I'll -- I'll start with GSIB if we take that in turn. So, starting with GSIB, as I said, we do think that we have opportunity in the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent and based on the Fed models. But we do think we have opportunity there based on the work that we've been doing. So, it will be very difficult for us to get back to 3.5% with the current expansion. So, we are expecting to remain in the 4% bucket but as you know that's not effective until early 2023. So that gives us time to manage SCB as I mentioned as an offset. On -- on the leverage issues, we have, you know, we can cure this through issuing preferred but we haven't made that decision yet, as I said, because it is -- it is a -- it is a critical decision for us to think about. And as you think about capital return, it would depend on where our stock prices as we think about the economic value of issuing preferred to buy back stocks. So, there is a lot for us to think about over the next couple of months.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Because you said the G-SIFI because it's very important. If we were on the international standard, our G-SIFI would be 2%, not 4%. And we have been talking about they were supposed to adjust GSIB before the growth of the economy and effectively the shrinking size of the banking system. Because the banking system itself is getting smaller as mortgages go to the nonbanks and private credit goes elsewhere, and the rest of the international, Chinese banks are growing, etc. So, these adjustments should be made. We pointed out as $1.3 trillion of liquid assets and marketable securities on a balance sheet, which shockingly reached G-SIFI 2. G-SIFI has no risk weighted measurements to it, no diversification to it, no profitability to it. It just kind of these very gross measures and it needs to be recalibrated and same with SLR. I mean, so do we expect it to happen? Probably not in our lifetimes, because we have politicized bank -- detailed bank numbers and so on, and we can live with it for now. But in the long run, it's not good for Americans, that much of a disadvantage to our competitors overseas.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Sorry. Sorry. Hi. Sorry, let me mute for a second there. Maybe just talking about loan growth. You saw a pretty nice improvement in the wholesale side. You talked about some opportunities in '21. It seems to be mostly coming out of the CIB. Is that sort of acquisition finance? What's -- what's driving some of the improvement on the wholesale side?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yeah, I would say acquisition financing is the -- is the opportunity on the wholesale side. You know, when we -- when we, you know, there may be some opportunity in the back half of 2021 in C&I that -- that I feel like it's returning to BAU but I think that's going to take some time. But as I said, we are at historic levels of cash on corporate balance sheet then so, outside of acquisition financing and -- and C&I. It -- it will be challenging. C&I in the back half of 2021.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then maybe on your expense assumptions for the $68 billion, you don't really mention at all any of the CIB. You would think that if -- if we are, as everyone assumes, you know, we had a record year in 2020, 2021 maybe markets and IB fees are lower.\n\n\n\n\n Is there any kind of -- are you building in some lower comp -- you know, revenue-based compensation expense in -- in that $68 billion or is that potential a positive?\xa0Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, we capture that in the volume and revenue related, Jim. It just happens to be more than offset by volume and revenue-related growth elsewhere.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n I just point out the $68 billion. We don't make commitments or promises, so that $68 billion, I would love to find $2 billion more of investments, literally. I mean, we are seeking every year find more to do to help clients around the world and stuff like that. So that's kind of our current forecast. And fortunately, we found some more to do, including cxLoyalty and opening more branches and some of the technology we are building, et cetera. But I'd like to find more. It would be the best and possible highest use of our capital.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, John.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi, Jen. Given the outlook for net interest income and expenses, it seems like the efficiency ratio is going to tick up a few 100 basis points this year '21 versus '20. And I know you don't manage it necessarily year to year but just kind of overtime you seem to have a mid 50s efficiency target. Just kind of wondering how you put guardrails up for yourselves in terms of expense discipline and managing overtime to have positive operating leverage and an efficiency quarter.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, I'll -- I'll start by saying you're absolutely right that we don't manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter or even any year, and the operating leverage is very important to us. And then we -- we gave a share in Investor Day at about a 55% efficiency ratio. I'll say, in a normalized environment, we haven't had anything that structurally has changed. And so, that should still be achievable for us in a normalized-rate environment and otherwise normalized environment. And then, as it relates to expense discipline you know it -- it is a bottoms-up process. And so, everywhere around this company, we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that which is why I call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that is in investments or volume and revenue related it isn't necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiencies.So the discipline is everywhere and it's -- it's the way we run the company and we do believe in -- in the importance of operating leverage through time, no doubt.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n \xa0OK. And then as a follow up on the NII walk, you've got a billion-dollar incremental NII expected in '21 versus '20 for markets -- CIB markets. Can that be true if market's revenues are down year over year? You know, can they both be true and just maybe explain that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, it can be -- it can absolutely be true. So the market is -- I mean, in most of our businesses, we don't run them NII versus noninterest revenue it -- it is an accounting construct about markets. It's particularly true. So yes, that is -- that is possible. In NII, the market business you can think about is -- is liability sensitive. So you know, you're going to see the benefit of lower rates in NII. That doesn't necessarily imply anything about the overall performance.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We have a positive carry. In trading, profit goes down and the carry goes up. But not -- the absolute numbers are the same.OperatorYour next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Hi, good morning. My first question is on the outlook for card losses. The 2.17% net charge-off rate was certainly eye-opening relative to, you know, what happened in 2020 and the discussions actually that I've been having with investors on the trajectory of card is, you know, do -- do you think that the bridge that the government built is strong enough that we may not see, you know, a spike in losses in card like we're all expecting? And Jen, given your comments earlier, what would you need to see to feel more comfortable about releasing reserves from your card portfolio?\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, it's interesting that you -- you brought up the bridge being strong enough. It does feel like at this point in this crisis, the -- the bridge has been strong enough. The question that still remains is is the bridge long enough. And so, while we just had a recent stimulus pass, that makes us feel better about the bridge being long enough. But we have to get through the next three months to six months. So, it feels like we have been saying that since this crisis started but I think it is particularly true at this point, obviously, given the vaccine rollout. So, you know, consumer confidence is still low relative to pre-COVID levels. You can converse that with -- compare that to the wholesale side, we are seeing confidence is up. That's not true on the consumer side. And so the next three months to six months is going to be critically important for us to assess whether or not only is it strong enough, but is it long enough, and do you see consumer sentiment pick up a bit.There's also possibility for payment shops as some, you know, relief programs, whether it be a student loan, forbearance or tax -- taxes owed on benefits received. There are things that could hit the consumer in the next three months to six months that we need to think about.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right. I would just add, very different for subprime and prime. And if you look at our portfolio, it's mostly prime. And the -- the folks in the prime category have a lot more income, a lot more savings, housing prices are up. They did not lose their jobs but the news there is actually rather good. On the lower quartiles, it's the opposite. Even now when we just did all the stimulus checks and we did about $12 million of them which have already been processed --Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n $12 billion.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer $12 million. $12 billion, $12 million for $12 billion approximately. And there's the bottom but the -- the folks who had $1,000 in their accounts, where the accounts are coming down and they just got $1,000, they obviously needed. The folks in the higher end, they obviously don't need quite as much. So, it's positive -- we expected to go up but it's possible somehow that doesn't happen in some dramatic way.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. And -- and Jamie, my second question is for you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'd say, we are making this point very important.\n\n\n\n\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We do not consider taking down reserves recurring or low income. We don't do show across. We don't consider a profit. It's -- it's ink on paper.\n\n\n\n\n It's based upon lots of different calculations. Obviously, we want real loss to be lower over time. But I would just -- if you -- if our card reserves like $17 billion, we took it down next quarter because we have more optimistic outlooks, we are not going to be sitting here cheering about that, we are cheering that market is doing better. But we don't want to consider those earnings. And I think you all should look at a little bit differently now, particularly with the change in accounting rules.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah. I think -- I think your investors appreciate that. And the second question I had for you, Jamie is, you know, in last -- on last year's Investor Day, it was clear to your investor base that you were looking to inorganically enhance your scale in AWM. And what interesting is that the discussion that I have been having with your investors more recently is them wondering whether or not you would consider a larger deal maybe in payments, you know, given that a lot of investors and banks are thinking that that's the, you know, the part that seems to be potentially more vulnerable to technology competitors.\n\n\n\n\n What are your thoughts there? And I guess, my -- my own thought process has been tempered by Jennifer's presentation on capital, but we wanted to get your thoughts there.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Again, we have -- I mean, our capital cup runneth over, OK. We have so much capital we cannot use it. If you look at what happened this year, our capital went from 12.4% to 13.3%. And by -- I think advanced is more representative of real risks so it will be 13.8%. That's after doing $2 trillion of loans, $12 trillion of reserves, $12 trillion -- $12 billion of reserved, $12 billion of dividend. I mean, we are earning -- if you look at pre-tax -- pre-provision $45 billion or $50 billion a year. So we're -- we're in very good shape to invest.The most important thing we said to management, we say that we grow that every business organically, every single one opening branches and accounts, doing payments, and we put a lot of time and effort in payments. We are quite good at it between credit card, debit card, Chase merchant services.\n\n\n\n\n But I agree with you and -- but we are open for inorganic too. Inorganic shouldn't be an excuse not for growing organically and -- and it's not just Chase, it's not just asset management, it will be an area where we could do that. I don't think cxLoyalty was neat thing, is [Inaudible] neat thing, we bought 55 IP, which is a special way to manage money, tax efficiently. And so we are going to build it ourselves or buy it. We are open-minded. Anyone you have good ideas for us, let us know. We have the wherewithal, but we thought we will also look at buying it. Like I said, we are always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently. We have got a tremendous set of assets. We also have a tremendous debt of competitors, particularly in payments, consumer land now, and a bunch of other areas. So you saw Google Pay. You saw Wal-mart is going to try to spend a bit more time is expanding. And we -- we like competition, we believe in it. But we have to be really prepared for that and that is deeply on our mind and how we run our business.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorYour next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Betsy.\n\n\n\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jamie, a question on cxLoyalty, because I thought your loyalty program and -- and capability set there in your payment space and your consumer-facing space was quite good. So, I am just wondering what the rationale was? And is there an expectation that you are going to be leveraging that into non, you know, card portions of your business, was that part of the -- so what was this deal?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, Betsy, I will take that one. So this -- this -- we are really excited about this one. And really with any tech platform, scale matters. So, combining our scale with cxLoyalty's innovative technology will be a win not only for our Chase customers but for cxLoyalty's existing clients and suppliers.\n\n\n\n\n And then -- and then you're right to point out our existing UR platform, but that today is predominantly used as a point production portal. So there's a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of our customer spend on travel which is $140 billion both on and off us. So in addition to capturing the full economic value of the existing redemptions on the platform, we also have an opportunity to really turn it into a great place for our customers to book travel.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. But still focused on the card space as opposed to moving into, you know, other parts of your relationship with consumers?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n It's -- it's -- it's con -- it's consumer, this thing it was consumer.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst [Inaudible]Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n That's not what you said, it has to be card only.\xa0Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jen, mentioned the number, like more than 30% of travel expense goes through our cards, something like that. And -- and so, we want to give a far better experience to our own customers when it comes to what we offer them to travel. You are right, ultimate reward always does a good job but why would you try to double that overtime or triple it?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n And we think we can -- we can -- we can do a better job for their existing clients and suppliers. So, it won't just be about Chase customers.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Exactly.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n OK. And then the follow-up question just on the technology budget increasing, I mean, I know this comes after a year of being somewhat stable year on year. And just wanted to dig into the comment you made on the -- on the page around data analytics, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence capabilities. Again, you have been a leader in this for a while. So you know, the question is what -- where's the whitespace that you are moving into? And can you give us a sense as to how important this is for some of the expansion that you are doing geographically in, you know, U.K. digital and some of the European footprint that you are expanding into?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So -- so first of all, cyber we are going to do -- we have to do whatever it takes and we are going to do that in -- in everything we do. But you mentioned, we built a brand new data centers pretty much around the world, which are a lot more efficient. They are going to be effectively -- they're not cloud base but they have all the cloud technology, etc, for our own private cloud. When we move other stuff to the public cloud, we are refactoring applications to get there, where we are doing all the data, you all know the issue with data, not that banks were bad, but data was held in all these different accounts, you are trying to build these data links, you can use AI and machine learning better and it all do haste.The cloud is real.\n\n\n\n\n The cost is real. The speed is real. The security is real. The AI is real. The machine learning is real. So every single business and with every single meeting we go through is talking about what are we moving to the cloud, whether it's internal or external? What are we adding AI machinery on? Are we getting the data analytics right and it is global. It's -- and we don't spend that much time on it. But every single business is doing it. You have a tremendous amount of AI being used in -- in asset wealth management, CIB, in trading, in commercial banking prospecting, and it's literally the tip of the iceberg. Whatever we say today, 10 years from now, it will be probably 50 times more than we are doing today. And I would spend anything to get it done faster.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Ken.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on -- on capital return and capital usage. In the deck and in your press release, you mentioned that you are looking to get back into more return of capital, you mentioned $4.5 billion net and there's still the net income test. And I just wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through how you think about, you know, full -- you know, how do you think about full usage of that $4.5 billion and then how do you think forward vis-à-vis the comments we just talked about with regards to potential external opportunities and what's the best use of that incremental capital, given that you still have, you know, a healthy amount sitting there?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So -- so, we always start in the same place, which is we would much prefer to do the things that Jamie's been talking about when to buy back our stocks. So, we would much prefer to deploy it to organic growth or -- or acquisitions. Having said that, we do as you point out have significant excess capital at this point.\n\n\n\n\n When we look at the first quarter, the -- the Fed capacity was defined by the trailing four quarters of profits and so when you back out our dividend, that's where you get to the $4.5 billion. So that is the, you know, capacity that we have for this quarter and we will do up to that amount, obviously. I don't know that we will do the full amount, but we'll -- we'll certainly do, obviously, can't do more than $4.5 billion. And then we -- we, you know, we are certainly hopeful that we can go back to the EU under the SCB framework beyond the first quarter as we think about buybacks. But -- but we will wait to see what the Fed says at the end of the first quarter.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer If you can manage your capital down to the 12% or whatever we said, with that regards have been getting permission from the Fed. They have already implied that's what they can do. That's the way it should be done eventually one day.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yep. Understood.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I want to point out is that, we have been consistent in 2 times tangible book, but our earnings power and dividend and all stuff like that, it still makes sense to buy back stock. But that diminishes, you know, every point, 2.1 or 2.2, or 2.3, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically or inorganically.\xa0Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, we will always look at the effective return of us buying back our stock for our remaining shareholders and if we think it makes sense relative to the alternative we are going to keep doing it.\n\n\n\n\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yep. Consistent with what you have said in the past. Thanks. And just a question on the card business, you mentioned how much of that spend goes through Chase, and just you are -- given that we still have some uncertainties with regards to a true return to open. Yeah, your card segment revenue yield actually did improve a little bit. I am just wondering if you can kind of help us, just think through, just the pushes and pulls you see on the card business with regards to your expectations of -- of spend improving, balances improving, and -- and competition underneath? Thanks.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yeah. So, the competition remains very, very strong. As it relates to the revenue yield, it's a little bit of noise there, because balances are down so much and that's what that's derived from. So there's a little bit of noise there. Importantly, you know, we -- we -- we do -- if GDP is back to 2019 levels by the middle of the year, we expect them to continue to recover, and perhaps, significantly, so in the second half. As it relates to travel, whether it's the second half of '21 or '22, we -- we are confident that our -- our customers will continue to travel and there's pent-up demand onshore for travel and so we are excited about those opportunities, whether they come, you know, in '21 or '22 or beyond.\xa0Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we take very seriously the new entrance like the Goldman Sachs card and there are a bunch of other folks who are doing similar things that we expect to see more of that.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorYour next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Glenn.\n\n\n\n\nGlenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hello, there. Thank you. So, I think it's good time of the year to get your mark-to-market on, your thoughts on the competitive landscape and I know every business is competitive. But I'm -- I'm more curious on the new side of competitive and maybe I am talking more about the consumer and commercial banking right now. But between all the neo banks that either want to pay much more than you guys on deposits or charge no fees, or the pay -- buy now pay later models, or things where you also even play in banking as a service in trying to provide banking products to big technology companies with big client footprints. I am most curious to see, is this just normal evolution and not changing things or -- or is there something bigger going on here that you -- you want to comment on? Thanks.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yeah. So I am going to -- in the commercial bank, it is probably less than you think. I do think there are alternative credit providers. But we will just do a lot of things for our clients, they can quit investment banking, FX swaps, cash management custody, asset management, etc. So it's slightly different. I got a consumer saw me and we wrote in the chairman's letter years ago that Silicon Valley is coming. And I think it's just more and faster and better and quicker. And we have to just be very conscious that includes pay now, pay later and we have some of the products ourselves, but our job is to make sure we use our unbelievable strength and client base and capability and Gordon always points out, when you have that kind of products that goes to keep it simple, clear, basic, what the customer wants, to just to deliver more and better and so we are quite conscious.And I would also add, by the way, it's not just that, you know, we've -- the team looks at and financial and early pay and -- and all these other competitors. I expect one day, you can see other big foreign banks back here again, including the big Chinese banks, the biggest ones were bigger than us. And you know, I'm -- that may be five years or 10 years out, but we better be thinking five years or 10 years out. And so they are all coming, we were comfortable, but you know, we're -- we're still exercising and taking our -- taking out vitamins, OK?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n And it's another reason our -- our investments are going up as much, yeah, because we are very well aware of it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Fair enough. Keep taking those vitamins. Maybe along the same lines, I think, you -- you spoke -- spoken about the power that the data of your own client footprints and -- and -- and franchises have. I am just curious, we haven't heard that much lately about what you are collecting, how you can use it, how you can use it to enhance the customer experience accelerate growth. You -- you have all this at your fingertips and people talk about data as being the new gold. I'm -- I'm curious on how you are thinking about it right now?\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, yes, and yes. That's all we are going to tell you. I mean, I have talked about how important AI is, obviously, the data in that. The AI and data are directly related and some of it gets used very well. But if you shut down, some of it doesn't get used well. We have restrictions, you know, far more restrictions than some of our Silicon Valley competitors. But still, there are ways to use our data to do a better job for our clients. And we do a tremendous amount already in marketing, risk, fraud, cyber, you name it. And we use a lot of that -- like a lot of that stuff also protects our clients in cyber.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorYour next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. I will ask my question -- I'll ask my question and go back in the queue. Just -- I guess I -- I miss your Investor Day. We have four slides to -- to talk about that.\n\n\n\n\n I guess, if your capital cup runneth us over, maybe your expense budget could run us over too. I mean, spending is certain, returns are uncertain. So, seems like there's more questions this year than in the past. You did get positive off the leverage last year during the pandemic. So, yes, you have earned the right to go ahead and spend more. I think most people would agree. But there's still just so many questions, so I will just ask on CCB. It looks like Slide 16. You mentioned going to all 48 states by mid-2021. I didn't really get all of that. So, what -- how many states have you been in and by the time you get to 48, how much spending is that? What's the game plan? What's your plan with branches? Others are shutting branches after the pandemic, you are expanding. If you could just give some color on that or if Gordon's on the call, we can hear from him too?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Gordon -- Gordon's not but -- so you know, we've -- we started this a while back to expand the branches and stuff like that. We are still -- we are closing plenty of branches. So if you look at what we are doing, we got the number of leads, we have closed like 1,000 the last four years or five years and we have opened like 1,000 or something like that. But -- and I think we did the Bank One JPMorgan deal, we were in 21 states, 23 states. And when we started the expansion originally, you know, the -- we -- we're very conscious that the world needs less branches and the shape of the branches differently and you made hub and spoke and we are always testing new things and stuff like that. But we still have almost a million people today who visit branches and it's down, but it's a million people a day, I forgot the number, it's 60% or 70% accounts still open in branches, small businesses still need branches. And the new branches that we opened in Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., they -- they have been doing quite well. And the shocking thing is doing quite well in card, consumer, investments, small business. So as we go to all the other states, we just want to be and we know we have to have certain size, not going in each state with one just to plant the flag. That would be a kind of waste of time. We look at the major markets, number of people already know us through Chase, and stuff like that. And so we are optimistic that the strategy will pay off and it will enhance our businesses and our capabilities and -- and other things, I am not going to tell you because it's very competitive. I think we have shared too much with our competitors in the past. So I am going to kind of shut myself up a little bit.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer No. But, Mike, I can just add a -- a little bit of color on the numbers. So we -- we had said that we were going to open up 400 new branches in market expansion. So we have done 170 So far. Importantly, in 2020, we did fewer than 90, and in 2021 we are going to do 150. And so, of course, we, you know, by 2022 or 2023, that's going to start to sunset. So there are in the numbers multiyear investments that, you know, will -- they are ramping maybe in '21, but they will ramp down now that obviously gives us the capacity to reinvest those dollars. But you know, we -- we have a lot of capacity within the numbers you see on the page to continue to increase investments without necessarily the absolute number going up. In tech as an example, 10% or 20% of that number in any given year is completed. So that gives us more dollars to reinvest. And then the only thing I'd add on branches is this like the franchise value that comes with opening up these branches in new states is extraordinary and I think underestimated because it gives us the ability to do state and municipal business that we wouldn't have otherwise been able to do. So it's not -- it's not just about consumer banking.\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And it gives me a chance to North Dakota, which is the only state I have never been in. But believe it or not, we already do a lot of middle market, credit card more in North Dakota. We just didn't do consumer banking. So, I do the second where I am allowed, I am on my way to like Bismarck or Fargo or something like -- [Inaudible]. The new head -- the new head of investor relations who is sitting in this room right now, Reggie Chambers, who I am sure you will get to know. This was part of what he did for the Sun Belt, which is the all branch expansion, though we don't really restrict them how much you can tell you. But -- but -- and including looking at different formats. We are not blind to the nature that you have the world changing and digital all that. So -- and we can very quickly, just so you know, I forgot the number, change the fleet, like if you said, you have got the world changing more rapidly, we are completely comfortable that in a five-year period, you can dramatically reduce the size of the fleet or the cost of the fleet, etc, while serving clients.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nMike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. So this is kind of like what you did with commercial bank few years back going to every state, I guess. But -- so 48 states, where were you, say, a year ago or three years ago, just to give final context to that?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 48 states three years ago. I mean, by the way, commercial bank, same thing. We talked about expansion. So we bought WaMu, you know, it took years, but we said we are going to do $1 billion in the WaMu states, which is mostly California, Florida, Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n So we got -- what we are very close to hitting that. I thought governor was like $908 million this year or something like that. I told the teams we reviewed it yesterday that when we hit $1 billion, I want to send a case of really expensive wine to a guy called, Steve Walker, who did it for us and have great -- and we told him, right, like great bankers, great capabilities, stuff like that. We were doing $400 million of investment banking business when we did the Bank One deal JPMorgan through the commercial bank. We set a target of $1 billion and $2 billion and $3 billion, we exceeded $3 billion. I think we did $3.5 billion. The new target is $4 billion. It's now 25% to 30% of domestic U.S. investment banking, which DCM, ECM, M&A through that network and the investment bank -- the commercial bank expanded into healthcare, technology and we have a couple of other areas we are going to be rolling out soon. So these expansions really make sense. They pay for themselves. They are relentless. They are hard to do. They are obviously right?\n\n\n\n\nMike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. I'll -- I'll requeue.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And remember the commercial -- the commercial bank generally these branches. It's very hard to judge -- and we have done it. But it's very hard to build a quality business without retail branches when you are a commercial bank. But you will see very few commercial banks that don't have retail branches.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Brian.\n\n\n\n\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the expense outlook. I noticed there was a small piece in there related to the workforce optimization, but I guess thinking in the broader context, as we get through COVID-19 and move to the post-COVID-19 world, the general thought process was that there would be this big expense save opportunity coming from that, work-from-home environment. But it doesn't really show in your expense outlook. Is it something that, you know, expect to see beyond 2021? Is this a, you know --Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yeah.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst Step down expenses?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n But-but in the big picture there are people expenses $33 billion, for real estate expenses, I am going to say $3 billion.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n So, yeah, even -- and I do think it can be much more efficient than that, but I don't think it's like a -- a -- a game changer.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And we can't move our footprint that quickly, anyway. So, we do -- we do have time here to make sure that we do it really thoughtfully.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n But Jen is thinking about moving the finance function to Florida.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hawaii. Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Hawaii.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hawaii, that's right.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n And then just a follow up, but maybe on the international, I saw still the billion hopes of additional revenue on the international. Just give an update on how that's tracking so far?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sorry, sorry, I didn't catch that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n The billion what?Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst On the international revenue expansion that you were looking for?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Oh. The -- firstly, that's some banking expanding globally everywhere as best we can and so as asset management. And because we already spoke about China and stuff like that, the commercial banks started an international expansion effort to cover companies overseas that we do business with here that we are not covering and it's doing fine. It's mostly expense right now. You know, we added bankers and products and services and legal and compliance and we didn't add -- we have been adding clients as we were quite happy with it. I should point out that we just had the best year ever in Asia. I mean, I think, it was up like 20% or something like that. So -- and you know, Asia is still will be one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. So our -- you know -- and that's kind of country by country to make sure we get that right.\xa0Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Jamie. Can you guys share with us, obviously, there's been a change in the administration in the Senate and a number of our regulatory body heads are going to be replaced this year, including the FCC and the Consumer Protection Bureau. Can you guys give us some color what you are thinking about what may change from a regulatory standpoint with the different political party controlling Washington now?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, our focus is always the same. We have got -- we have got 60 million U.S. clients. We have got 6,000 investment clients around the world. We have got -- we run this company to serve clients, communities, hospitals. We financed $100 billion in states, cities, schools, hospitals each year. That's what we do.\n\n\n\n\n And obviously, we want to satisfy all of our regulators. So I do expect that there will be a new set of regulators. We will have a new set of demands. Some we agree with. We want to do a better job in climate for the world. We want to be more green. We want to help the disadvantaged. We rolled out an enormous amount of progress in racial equality and things like that. So, yeah, but they will be tougher. That's -- that's life. It's life around the world. We are going to -- we have to do a whole bunch of new regulators, which we are trying to satisfy in the ECB, etc. And so, it's -- I don't need to change our life that much and competitively, everyone's in the same kind of boat and, you know, so it -- it will be fine. And we -- we want the new president to be successful.\n\n\n\n\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst And then following up, Jennifer, you talked about on Page 17 of your slide deck, the -- the issue with deposits and the marginal benefit of these deposits and you guys are, you know, wrestling with this issue? Can you share with us, yeah, and you already have talked about the, you know, the branch expansion in all 48 states could save U.S. states? How is this going to be managed as best you can over the next 12 months to 24 months, because obviously, long term, you want that branch expansion, but simultaneously, as you have pointed out, you -- you may be getting a negative ROI, if you don't get relief on the SLR? And is there a chance that you will get that extension on the SLR from the regulators?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, I will start with -- we -- we certainly remain hopeful that we will get the extension. Importantly, as we think about branch expansion near-term rate headwinds, we certainly consider that, but at the margin there, not a factor given the long-term franchise value associated with the branch expansion and -- and the fact that it's not just about deposits for any one consumer anyway, because we have the opportunity to have a much broader relationship with them and all of that is factored into the branch expansion. But we do consider in -- in the analytics there the near-term headwinds from -- from rates. But -- but there is a steady-state number which is more of a normalized level of rates.\n\n\n\n\n So it doesn't --\xa0 it doesn't -- at a margin it might change some decisions around marketing, but it -- it doesn't have a big impact on us.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. The bigger decisions on that which we have a lot of leeway on is out of the investment bank. It's repo, deposits, corporate clients, trade finance, all those other things. So the -- this is managed very, very closely. Remember GSIB uses one of, say, 20 constraints we managed by business, by product, by area, by region, by --\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And we -- and bring it up, obviously, it is an issue for us in the near to medium term, should we not get the extension and it's one that's important for people to understand. But we bring it up more so because it should, another example of, you know, where lack of coherence around these rules can have an impact, not just on JPMorgan. So we don't bring it up just because of the impact on JPMorgan. We bring it up because it is perhaps one of the better examples of the need for recalibration. You have to have the right incentives in the system for it to work through time and we are just seeing that's not the case.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n So we don't want to do it, it is very customer friendly and say, could you take your deposits elsewhere, but --Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Right.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n They do have -- a lot of this larger corporate client who have other options and bunch of deposits, but money market funds or something like that. So, we are mad. It is not -- none of this is going to be an issue for 2021, folks. I mean, fundamentally, it is just how we were a company. And even -- even if that temporary relief goes away. And I am always against temporary relief, because for this exact reason, it creates another cliff, even if it goes away we are fine, we just have to manage it much tighter.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi. Maybe a bit of a basic question, but why is markets revenue are trading so good still, not just for you, but the overall wallet? You know, I get it to be investment banking business, the feeder businesses still very good, there's lots of liquidity, banks have lots of capital, but of course, rates are near zero, budget tight, volatility is low. I will take away some of the answers. But you know, just conceptually it's been very strong.\n\n\n\n\n It sounds like the hope is it will remain strong. What's really driving it?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There is $350 billion of global financial assets, $50 trillion -- $350 trillion, and probably, in 10 years or 20 years that number is going to be $700 trillion. People have to buy and sell to hedge, finance, with money around the world, FX, currencies, our pension plans. You know, obviously, volumes go up and down. You know, spreads generally over time has been coming down, what you would expect in a competitive market. So -- but -- but the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks around the world that Jen showed you, the $3 trillion or $4 trillion in the Fed, but globally it is $12 trillion. And you know, companies have a lot of financing to do. And -- and of course, when you have higher DCM and higher ECM and higher M&A that also drives a lot of trading and so you got to kind of put that all in the mix.\n\n\n\n\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And obviously, the question is how sustainable is this, and I guess, one argument could be that technology has allowed banks to increase the velocity. You can talk about this for some time. Do you think that is a structural change that will benefit the businesses and specifically for you guys over a long-term time period?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. The way we look is we kept our share of what things we are trying to find digitized and the business has done a kind of the way we expected them to do it. So, yeah, we think scale matters, technology matters, and hopefully, we think we can even grow our share. This is just trench warfare.\n\n\n\n\n So we expect to grow it, but we, you know, I don't -- it's a very hard to say what the base level is and we thought that the base level kind of revise down sometime last year, but will stay as high as it stayed in 2020 then I doubt. It may not go back to what it was. It may be higher than that.\xa0OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Hi, Charles.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst Good morning. I have a couple of questions related to fintech and unfortunately, I was born in a wrong generation, so I need a lot of help. How dependent is the fintech world on the banking system, as I understand they lay on top of the pipes in the plumbing of the banking system. Do you have any leverage in a competitive world against the fintech world? And -- and then, secondly, I noticed that the OCC gave banks the green light to use public blockchain networks and stable points. Can you explain how -- what important that has to JPMorgan?\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You go ahead with blockchain there.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, OK, sure. So -- so that -- that guidance enables an offering of stable going on a public blockchain. So that doesn't impact JPM coin. JPM coin, you should think about as the tokenization of our customer deposits.\n\n\n\n\n So, it's obviously very early. We will assess use cases and -- and customers demand. But -- but it's still too early to see where this goes for us.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we are using blockchain for sharing data with banks already and so we are at the forefront of that which is good. The other question was about fintech. You know, look, first of all, they are very good competitors. And I pointed out to a lot of people, you know, PayPal were $250 million, Squares were done in $20 million, Stripe is worth $80 billion, Ant Financial is down quite a bit now. But they are there. They are strong. They are smart, some effectively ride the rails. So we bank a lot of them.\n\n\n\n\n You know, we help them accomplish what they want to accomplish and you have -- so my view is we are going to compete, we will need to and we have to look at our -- look inside about what we could do better or could have done better and things like that. So I am confident we will be able to compete. But I think we now are facing old generation of newer, tougher, faster competitors who -- and if they don't buy the rails of JPMorgan, they can buy rails of someone else. So you see, I have told you before, everyone is going to be involved in payments. Some banks going to white label, which makes -- which makes fintech competitors white label the bank and build every sort of thing on top of it and we have to be prepared for that. I expect it to be very, very tough competition in the next 10 years. I expect to win. So help me God.\xa0Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst Thanks. So did they need the banking system to complete their loop of -- of service or can they work completely outside the bank?\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, the most will do for now, but I think it's a mistake because it's going to be forever. The game of bank licenses, Utah is giving industrial licenses. Like I said, banks are white labeling. So it's effectively the same thing. If you know, if fintech companies uses a white label bank just to process their business, they're -- they're basically a bank. You know, when -- what the regulator will do, I don't know, but we have to assume that they are going to do it. And that some don't need, we'll -- we'll find ways, not to use their banking system, which they have done. I mean, if you look at a whole bunch of the things they have used stuff around the banking system, which is fine, I am not against that. The regulators may have a point of view about that one day, but I am less worried about that. I am going to worry about us.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi Andrew.\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi. Hi. Good morning. And so...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, Charles, one other point, if our examples unfair competition, which we will do something about eventually. People who we will make a lot more on debit, because they activate under certain things, the only reason they compete is because of that. People you know, basically, don't do KYC AML and create risk for the system. And I can go on and on, but that part we will be a little bit more aggressive on, people who improperly use data has been given to them by client, OK? So you can expect that there will be other battle to take place here.\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi. Sorry. It's Andrew Lim here. So I just wanted to pick your brains on inflation and hopefully, inflation metrics are picking up. If we look at rates, if you look at the inflation indicators and that's like a lot of people are jumping on this replacement bandwagon. But I just wanted to see what you are seeing on the ground in the real world as to how this might be manifesting itself even in commercial banking or in investment banking in terms of like the month, products, or volatility. Is that something that you -- you see as a scene developing?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n I mean, look, we don't have that much more insight than you do. You do see signs witnessing in commodities and certain products and consumer goods and stuff like that. It's hard to tell that, you know, supply lines that can't keep up with demand or you have long-term trends, China is no longer ending the world. That -- that can change inflation. I think and we looked at when Jen gave those numbers, she always using implied curve. I think the best way to think about it is, I think this should be a much bigger conversation next year because we have good growth. I think it's a good thing that we have good growth and part inflation, but that will become part of the conversation, how bad, what I am going to do and things like that. Just so the risk management thing, you got to build into your mindset that, you know, you have got to look at there has been a possibility. So you know, I think a year ago, people have said, not possible before COVID and now because the world has done $12 trillion of QE and something like $10 trillion to $12 trillion of fiscal stimulus, you have got to put on that thing a scenario where you have higher inflation and not 2%. That would be great. It is like Goldilocks. But like 3%, 4%. Just so you understand what the risk is and how we manage through that. It is not the worst thing in the world by the way. The worst in the world is no growth.\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Great. OK. And -- and for my follow-up question, you -- you talked about how you resolved the issue of excess deposits by pricing way about $200 billion of those. So I am just wondering why you don't do that now or is the quantum of the problem that much bigger?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We don't have that all, Jen.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. We don't have to. It's also -- it is slightly different in the sense that there was capacity in the system then to absorb it. This is an issue for everyone. So you know, that -- that could be a challenge. We can't make them go away.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, Jamie, on the topic of payments and competition, you know, Libra's -- Facebook's Libra is back out there getting rebranded as Diem and their goal is basically to be global payment network or at least to create one. I am wondering does the OCC stable coin approval do anything for you? You already have JPM coin obviously that's internal to your own footprint? But I am wondering is there any benefit of the OCC stable coin approval, is there anything with regard to Libra competition that's coming that, you know, would -- would drive changes that you are making in your own platforms?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n I don't think so. But -- I don't think so. We expect stable --Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n And you know, obviously, there is this talk about several banks having digital currencies and stuff like that, right? Their currency is digital when we move around the world. It's in central banks where it will move by electrons and stuff like that both. So I -- I do expect that stuff is coming and it may not change our world that much. But some of the competitors what they want to do, they want to be in payments. They want the payments data. They want to move the money. Again, it's going to be a regulatory issue about what that means and --Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst And then can I mention --\n\n\n\n\nJamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible] is not unfair. That's the only thing I can point. So as long as the competition -- as always we can do it safely and competition can do then it's hard to argue this -- that's unfair.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And -- and Betsy, I mentioned earlier, you might have missed it, but it does not impact JPM coin, JPM coin is -- is different. You should think about that as tokenizing deposits to make payments easier for client.\n\n\n\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Right. Yeah. No.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah.\n\n\n\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah. No. I totally get that. I was just thinking hey, if OCC is allowing stable coin maybe they are trying to, you know, help move the center of this back, you know, into the banking system. That was, you know, kind of a question. The follow-up was just on back to Slide 14 and the other purple, you know, area, where the nontechnology expenses are moving up year on year and part of that is the $30 billion commitment to the path forward initiative. And -- and Jamie, I wanted to understand, like, how you are thinking about that $30 billion? What kind of time frame is that over, you know, and where that money is going? I mean, we put a note out as you know, this past quarter on housing and on housing inequality and wondering how you are thinking about how you are going to be investing that $30 billion in kind of output that you want from it?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Right. So, we believe that inequality is a real problem. And -- and people don't always know, but like, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less, which is $32,000 a year something like that. 50 million don't have employment and people at the lower end are dying quicker than they did before. So first time in our lifetimes, our grandparents lifetimes, American's mortality is getting worse, not better and society have to fix these problems. Now we need healthy growth, healthy growth I mean like, but you also need education, infrastructure, healthcare, and affordability. The racial problem has been around for 100 years and with all the things that took place after even -- after the civil rights, we haven't made the progress we should have made. So we -- and fortunately, lot of other people and companies take this really seriously. How can we help all of the American citizen in particular the black community who has been left behind for so long. So our effort is five years, the $30 billion includes, I've got -- I've got the exact numbers we published $8 billion of mortgages to in lower, middle-income neighborhoods, black neighborhoods, primarily black neighborhoods. It includes affordable housing, building --\xa0 affordable housing includes billions of dollars for entrepreneurs of color, it includes defense education. We recently went over a million secure card which is what we expected to do because these are cards that have all the benefits of banking ATMs, online bill pay for $4.95 a month, you know, for lower-paid individuals who are doing more, more education. Of those 400 branches we are opening, 25% or more will be in LMI neighborhoods. We are financing MBI's and CBFI's. So it's a serious effort, it costs $100 million a year. There are hundreds of people involved here.\n\n\n\n\n So we have a debt how many loan we are going to put in this neighborhood and how many loans we are going to put in that neighborhood. And we are going to report it that to you, we are not going to -- and we are doing work, we don't mind things not working, but it will change courses and stuff like that. And so -- and obviously, it includes hiring more open black community training here and stuff like that. So I think, these efforts, in my own view, is that the corporate world has to do this if you want to fix it. It's not going to happen. We need good government. It is not going to happen just with good government. The jobs at the local level. Unemployment sell branches 20% or 20 is still high. The kids didn't have computer to go home and do their Zooming and schools didn't have them. And unfortunately, a lot of planned appeasing, including my wife, send lot of computers to people there, but we have to do something about this. We are always so forth. And in my view, we should do it for more purposes of loan that would be sufficient, but for commercial purposes do it. If all the parts American doing better, outcomes and more jobs and healthier people, less crying, less prisons, less drugs, and so it's time to get our act together. And again, I think, businesses have to work in collaboration with the government to do it. I just don't think it is going to happen alone.\n\n\n\n\n It is not going to happen just by yelling at people. You know, the successful companies do not create the slums, but they can help fix them.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi. Just following up more on the market expansion. In commercial banking, could you just drill down deeper on the international part of that expansion and what's left to be done in U.S.?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think -- I'll answer the U.S. but -- are you in U.S.? Again, we are not going to share so much information from now on. But it's the same thing we looked at all the major SMSAs with the middle-market companies, we are doing deep dive in how many there are. And I think, we are now in 75 of the top 75 roughly. So, that expansion is now just going deeper not maybe more at this point. There will be helped little bit by the retail expansion. I think, overseas -- I just -- I just don't have the number on my left hand.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I don't know either.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. But if you are talking about -- that will eventually cover and I could be dead wrong in this, 1,000 more clients overseas. These are headquarters or subsidiaries of foreign companies that we probably do business with headquarters subsidiaries in the U.S. and we could share more of this with you later down the road.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And I would just --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I will tell Charlie, he can't imitate me on this one.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Mike, I -- I would just add just from an expense perspective. It is important to remember on the international front that we are riding existing rails that are already there in the CIB. So we can -- this is -- this is an extraordinary opportunity to hire bankers and we already have the infrastructure.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We already -- and we used to generally bank the U.S. subsidiary.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Our U.S. headquarters.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, it's not the list you might think from an expense perspective.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. And then, just a follow up on the other questions that have been asked related to fintech. Jamie, you said, you are going to win, right. But based on evaluations of the PayPal, Stripes, and Visa, Mastercard anything that fintech related.\n\n\n\n\n I mean, they -- they trounce valuation of your stock. I think, the market saying that others are going to win. So how is JPMorgan is going to -- I mean you said, Silicon Valley is coming what, that was like six years ago or something and then -- and then each year we say, yeah, we missed it, we missed it, we missed it, well, it's still --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No. No. No. We never said we -- Mike, we never said we missed it. We have been doing fine over these five years. I started to like -- but -- but I do agree with you, you know, I gave that to the management team. My whole operating committee a little deck that show Visa, $500 billion; Mastercard, $350 billion; PayPal, $220 billion; Ant Financial, $600 billion; Tencent, $800 billion; you know, Alibaba, trillion; Facebook; Google; Apple; Amazon; you can go on and on. But absolutely, we should be scared shitless about that.\n\n\n\n\nMike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst So how are you going to win? I mean, just what -- like what --\xa0Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I am not going to tell you. But we have -- but we have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We just got to get quicker, better, faster, and that's the -- which we do. We have got -- we have done an exceptional.\n\n\n\n\n If you look at what we have done, you would say, we have done a great job. But other people have done a good job too. Some have monopolies, virtually, it is a whole different issue, but --OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Hi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Hi, hi. Just one follow up. Obviously, Jennifer, you pointed out that your mortgage production revenue was quite healthy in the quarter and you have penetrated the correspondent champ. Can you guys share with us on the servicing side, with the new, you know, with the forbearance programs that the government has put into place, is that a positive or negative for servicing revenue as we go forward?\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, gosh.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jen will answer that one.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Yeah. I don't even know exactly how to answer it, Gerard. All I can say is that, when we give -- when -- when we give customers the help that they need -- if that's what the bridge them to the other side of this thing, for sure it is good. So, I -- I don't know precisely what the math is, but there's no doubt it's good if it helps get our customers to the other side. We do service their mortgage.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n In the -- in the past when loans go into delinquency, obviously, and there is -- in a mortgage-backed security, obviously, you guys have to advance the funds and stuff. But the deferral loans are not in that -- I am assuming they are not in that category, is that correct?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Not yet. But you are absolutely right.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n OK.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n The cost of servicing, the default of loan is like 10 times the cost of servicing and nondeposit loans. So Jen is right. Although we don't prudently default, there is probably a small benefit.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Great.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n I -- I -- I got you. We are talking about advancing the -- the servicing cost. Got it.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That's not an issue either.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yeah. No.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Appreciate it.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n [Inaudible] at this level.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Folks, thank you very much for spending time with us.

Apple (AAPL 1.27%)Q1 2025 Earnings CallJan 30, 2025, 5:00 p.m. ET
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of investor relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. 
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness+, Beats, and more, L.A.

is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts, and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now, turning to the quarter.
Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year over year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others.
In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record. And in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our install base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S.
English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now, users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use Writing Tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with Clean Up. We introduce visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings.
Users can also seamlessly access ChatGPT across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India.
And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like private cloud compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud.
Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions.
Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced, it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year over year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup.
The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launch pad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips, to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super-portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable but is our first carbon-neutral Mac.
All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad, from the ultra portable iPad Mini built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go, and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup.
Wearables, home, and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner, more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips in watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work because we know how much it matters to our users.
We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2. And new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display.
Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process, and the incredibly talented director, Jon M. Chu, recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie ""Wicked"" to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan.
Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of ""Severance"" earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like ""The Studio"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors."" And we can't wait for the premiere of ""Formula 1"" starring Brad Pitt on June 27th, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV Plus continues to draw attention and accolades.
Today, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an AirTag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season.
We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. And we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members.
There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was in AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment.
Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature, like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential.
We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue, with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track.
Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our install base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets.
Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year over year.
This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Operating cashflow is also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year.
We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan, and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone active install base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan.
We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year over year. We saw strength across our lineup, from the new Mac mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.
This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac install base reached an all-time high, and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S.
was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year over year, driven by the new iPad mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad install base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S.
based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year over year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we faced a difficult compare against the Watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.
Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future.
We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform.
We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness+, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises, such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S.
with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed thousands of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. And Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise with Cisco's new spatial meetings, delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning.
Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion.
During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.
The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar strengthens significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow low double digits year over year.
When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.
Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13th, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Kevan. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
Great, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You know, Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could, you know, better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already.
And then, I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Erik. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence that the year over year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments, from Writing Tools to Image Playground and Genmoji, to visual intelligence and more.
And so, we see all of those being used. The Clean Up is another one that is popular, and people love seeing that when demoed in the stores as well. We only had two, two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2. And then, only had the U.K.
and the other English language countries for the two and a half weeks. And so, we've got, you know, just the early indications at the moment. But we were glad --
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
OK. That's really helpful.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Go ahead.
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
OK. Thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently.
If we set aside China macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple Intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles? Just maybe double-clicking on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard -- as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year over year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And, of course, on the Apple Intelligence side, we have not rolled out in China.
And as we just talked about, we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And, of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so, all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in -- very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter.
There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20th. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smartwatches up to a certain maximum price point. And so, we do see fiscal stimulus occurring, and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And hey, Tim, wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute. And I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are are going to -- if anything's happened that changed your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway.
But I'd love your perspective on that, and then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And, you know, that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.
As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud, and which mimics from an architectural point of view what happens on device. And from a capex point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure, and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which, I think, continues to serve us well.
Ben Reitzes -- Analyst
Great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like -- I guess, what do -- you know, you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the -- you know, that the current lineup kind of shows where you're going? I guess, without pulling punches, wondering if you thought, in terms of the phone innovation, if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years.
Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think -- Ben, I think there's a lot more to come, and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So, I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.
Ben Reitzes -- Analyst
Thanks a lot, Tim.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone operators, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to. Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The install base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16 compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15.
And so, I think you can conclude from that that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So, lots --
Mike Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great, thank you, Tim. That's --
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, lots of good color there.
Mike Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then, I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro.
You know, how did it help iPad sales overall? And what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter. And it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry-level iPad than it was the top-level iPad. But overall, we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%.
It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably, what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So, that tells us that, you know, there's a good amount of customers there to attract.
Mike Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you very much, Tim.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani -- Analyst
Good afternoon everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products. Can you just at a high level just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then, do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or, perhaps, starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know, from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there.
We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also -- the iPhone was the top-selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets, and so there's a huge market. And we have very modest share in these markets, and so I think there's lots of upside there.
And that's just one of the emerging markets.
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets, we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well, so that's also an encouraging sign.
Amit Daryanani -- Analyst
Perfect. Thank you. And then, I guess, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margins flattish on a sequential basis.
Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margin? And, you know, Kevan, maybe you can just talk about is FX having an outside impact in your margin profile as well in March.
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Amit, let me take that one. You know, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5 %. So, we think we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes.
We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. It'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by, you know, favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also -- as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have, you know, a loss of leverage.
So, there are some puts and takes, and, you know, I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan -- Analyst
Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly channel inventory across your different product lines and regions. Do you feel they are elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess, in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter on quarter into the March quarter in China in particular? And I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
You know, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region. But if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis, we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position. In China, my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. If you look -- part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter.
And so, we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.
Wamsi Mohan -- Analyst
OK. That's very clear. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you.
Wamsi Mohan -- Analyst
And then, maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong, and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So, how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that, let's say, you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I think, one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter at 14%. And that was a -- one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad-based across all of our services. So, we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio.
And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, you know, we continue to see, you know, increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about, you know, reaching all-time highs. And we have over now a billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads, both. And I'm just curious in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines.
And more interest also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where, I think, there's a lot of conversation around AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16%. And on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by a very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air.
And so, as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac, and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so, I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.
Samik Chatterjee -- Analyst
And I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of more diversification of the supply chain. And how should we sort of think about that strategy related to that particular country? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, if you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so, in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in-country. And so, that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.
Samik Chatterjee -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt -- Analyst
Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So, maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business.
But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter and if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year. So, how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then, second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, you know, obviously, it's done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of on the services side at least where margins could go -- it looks like, you know, the 75% margin spending, incredibly successful quarter, but just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the -- you know, over the intermediate term? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, if you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so, that gives us a, you know, positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say that I think I mentioned earlier is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so, that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family.
And so, I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so, it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, great. Hi, David, how are you? So, on the services gross margin, I think maybe stepping back a second, you know, services business in general is -- in aggregate, is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things is an important reminder is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles.
And so, I think one is because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so, one of the big factors that drives the services gross margins are relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being, you know, accretive to margins as well.
And so, in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver, you know, that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration, you know, what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint at 46.5 to 47.5, which, again, we think is a strong guide.
David Vogt -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, guys.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim.
You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year over year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that is driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Mac.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling. The M4-based products are so compelling that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level, and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so, we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then, a follow-up for Kevan on the growth margin.
I want to ask you more on the product side. You know, last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to the year-ago period. I'm kind of curious, how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thanks, Krish, for the question. So, on the product side, as you mentioned, you know, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points for the December quarter. You know, that was really driven by -- we talked about favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume.
I would say, in general, you know, our gross margin of products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the, you know, various product launches that we have, different products do have different margin profiles. And so, that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mixes across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate toward our pro products, you know, because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get, you know, into our best products, which have, you know, favorable gross margins.
So, we're continuing to see that trend, you know, the impact of this in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so, you know, we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then, you know, that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter.
But we figured, you know, that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave in the 46.5% to 47.5%.
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Thanks, Kevan. Thanks Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess, do you see this simply as a question of time, i.e., to launch more markets and languages, or increase the percentage of install base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend toward AI.
And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so, as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow.
And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get hundreds of emails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So, I think it's a combination of that. And, of course, in April we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
OK, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability is fairly stable. What observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlock potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?
Kevan Parekh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a good question. I think, you know, one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean, we always take into consideration, you know, looking at short-term, you know, comparisons between short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy which would serve us pretty well.
And I think we're going to, you know, continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
OK. Thanks.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product or consumer demand under Trump 2.0? You guys did fine under Trump 1.0.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.
Atif Malik -- Analyst
Great. And, Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded Siri expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced on Apple Intelligence?
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think the killer feature is different for different people. And -- but I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And, certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.
Atif Malik -- Analyst
Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?
Operator
Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Bollin -- Analyst
Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts in how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And, in particular, curious if you look at the strengths you saw in fiscal '21 and how that might support, you know, accelerated refresh opportunity into the future.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean, you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then, you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points.
And so, I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories.
Benjamin Bollin -- Analyst
That's it for me. Thanks, Tim.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations

Apple (AAPL 1.27%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallOct 31, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ET
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q4 fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, director of investor relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and CFO, Luca Maestri; and they'll be joined by Kevan Parekh, vice president of financial planning and analysis.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Additionally, today's discussion will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. 
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year over year.
When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 959% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.
They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…
*Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025
We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the U.K., Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today.
And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligent system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple Innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with private cloud compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users with systemwide writing tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages.
And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December with even more powerful writing tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT integration as well as localized English in several countries, including the U.K., Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers, and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone.
iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16 powered by 18 is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. And iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio-quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life.
Turning to Mac. Revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing-fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows.
And they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them. Whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year over year.
iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro.
In Wearables, Home, and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition.
We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on Watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watching people's lives. With AirPods 4, we've broken new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives.
I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life-changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver special experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2 as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.
And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking.
Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup Playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device.
Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue where energy and enthusiasm filled the air.
And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter, and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun.
Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities helping with everything from access to technology to educator resources to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch.
These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come.
Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today.
He has helped manage Apple for the long term thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
We are very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year over year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and a large number of customers who are new to our products.
Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix.
Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year over year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.64, up 12% year over year and a September quarter record.
Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year over year and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the U.S., the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment.
During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air.
Customers have been loving the performance of Apple silicon on Mac, and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the U.S. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year over year.
In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year over year.
The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for Watch in the U.S. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year over year. Services continued to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem.
And we see increased customer engagement with our Services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago.
And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked No. 1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row.
Turning to enterprise. We continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees.
We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities.
We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.
The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%.
We expect opex to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024, to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please? 
Operator
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hey. Good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence.
I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence, both for iOS 18.1 but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And this includes things like systemwide writing tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages.
There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence.
Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful writing tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the U.K., Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out in -- starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very, very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.
Michael Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great. Thank you very much. And my second one, just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role, and it's been a real privilege of being able to spend some time with you.
A question that, I think, will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the capex outlook and whether investments in things like private cloud compute could change the historical capex range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Michael. On the capex front, I mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use third-party providers.
So, our capex numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now. And so, we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of capex that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24.
And we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related capex will be made.
Michael Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years, you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply.
As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years and if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down, and being more price sensitive. And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then I have a follow-up.
Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago, and so what we've got now from a data point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there.
In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions, and that's -- some spilled over. But in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products.
And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max. We've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other.
And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So, that's what I would say there.
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
OK. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role.
There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input cost and commodity prices and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor.
But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter, and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year, the entire fiscal year of '24. They are really, for our company, record levels of gross margin and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about a lot of new products across the board. I think it's a very good sign.
Erik Woodring -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much, Luca.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you. Erik.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thank you very much. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst
Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. We'll miss you and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again.
And with regard to the fourth quarter is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? And then I have just a follow-up. Thanks.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. You know, Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages.
And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we'll leave it at that. We've given you the total for the company and some pretty good direction on services, which we expect to continue to grow at a similar rate than what we've seen in fiscal '24.
Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst
Well, great. Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean -- and you guys are well aware, a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times. And you guys are guiding for mid- to low single-digit growth.
That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can. But you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like you guys are typically conservative.
That guide for revenue is -- certainly sounds like the sky is certainly not falling and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing? And what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well -- working on and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If -- the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken the hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read.
I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the Watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days, three launches of different Macs and desktops, and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out because if not, it would just be deafening.
And so, that's what I do. I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.
Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst
Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani -- Analyst
Yep. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well.
Luca, best of luck in the future. It's been a pleasure working with you. I guess the first one I have is away from my iPhone. On the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself.
As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Amit. I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion.
You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased we've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and it's growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services.
That continues to grow strong double digits. So, we feel very, very good. And essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.
Amit Daryanani -- Analyst
Got it. And if I can just follow up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. Just wondering if you could just touch on what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China if the recent stimulus plans in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhones. And then EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth.
Maybe you can just flesh that out as well for us. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year over year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange, and so that helped us out.
As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. But the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%.
Watch is over three-quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there. But I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
On the Europe side, I mean, a number of things. As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double digits, 11%. And really, it was really good growth across the board. The different segments, they all did well.
Keep in mind our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE. And we also include India, where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say, also Western Europe grew nicely.
So, we've seen very, very good results for us in the entire segment.
Amit Daryanani -- Analyst
Great. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from David Vogt both with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, everyone for taking my questions. And congratulations, Luca. I know, Luca, and I know, Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity.
But if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume, based on sort of the commentary, that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter, if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related given the strength that you've seen in iPad-related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then I have a follow-up.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We've given you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that we are launching.
And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.
David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst
Right. OK. So, maybe a follow-up for Tim. When you think about, to Luca's point, about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, or the June quarter, etc., relative to history given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically.
Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, David. It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. And we -- as we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would roll out over time, and we're right on the -- what we said at WWDC. And so, we're executing well.
In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting. And so, we'll see. We're not projecting beyond the current quarter obviously.
We just don't do that.
David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, Tim, and best of luck, Luca.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you so much. Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with U.S. English. That started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only U.S.
English but also localized for U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality.
That's what we're doing.
Wamsi Mohan -- Analyst
OK. Thanks, Tim. And then as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature. But how is Apple, at a high level, prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post this election cycle? And if not exactly, help -- perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts -- potential impacts?
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
You know, I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things, and so I'm going to punt on that one.
Wamsi Mohan -- Analyst
OK. Thank you, Tim.

Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks, Luca, for all your help with analysts and investors.
My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then I had a follow-up.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology, to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Got it. Got it. Thanks for that. And then another quick follow-up.
I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today. But do you think that in the future it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business? Or is that too -- are those too bifurcated to even make a call on the -- this early in the cycle? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M Series products and on certain models of iPad and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. Your -- what was your follow-on question?
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Two of those. One, can the Apple Intelligence actually help? And how the services growth rate -- 
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Keep in mind that we have released a lot of APIs, and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well, and of course, more are coming. And so, I definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.
Krish Sankar -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks, Tim.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.

Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role, and a pleasure working with you these years.
I guess if I can, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side and what I'm really curious about, if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which -- sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
It's tough to answer your question because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.
Samik Chatterjee -- Analyst
OK. OK. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter or, I think, over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue-sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcome that you're looking at? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
You know, I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case. And I will save that for another day.
Samik Chatterjee -- Analyst
OK. No, thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer

Suhasini Chandramouli -- Director, Investor Relations
All right. Thank you so much. Operator, may we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Thanks very much. First one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components of services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that? And what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider or widening addressable markets like we've seen in Pay or advertising?
Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those, and so there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the services and adding new features and whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that, for us, we're more focused on being best than being most, and so in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross-platform. We make them for our customers only. And so, that, in some cases, changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps.
But that's -- our objective is to make the best.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
OK. Thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash.
We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is at your scale now with $57 billion of opex, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Well, obviously, as you've seen, our opex has gone up over the years. We've also seen, at the same time, a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources, and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term.
But our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders, and the plan has worked quite well so far.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
OK. Thank you very much.

Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey, and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India.
As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year over year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day. Let me discuss the three factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact.
On a constant currency basis, we grew year over year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described in a November 6th update with COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have, every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continue to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker.
Production is now back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances from inflation, to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same.
We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people, and in the positive difference we can make in the world.
And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create. Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone.
Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year over year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone.
During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac.
Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro, and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be. During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion.
The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors. Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year over year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category.
As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature arriving later this spring allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified.
We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with the wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S.
and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get emails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them. We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate.
In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction, and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just seven years ago.
This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem. We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions.
Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited.
And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses, and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner, Ted Lasso, returning this spring. During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk.
And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri, and other apps. Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey.
And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID, and advanced data protection for iCloud.
At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to lead the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards.
In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face, and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial, equity, and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity. During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education, and more.
And over the last 16 years through our partnership with RED, Apple supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need. As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been.
With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points.
In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets. Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December.
On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call. Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base.
This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products. The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China.
We also set records in many services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin.
Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.
iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 4 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy, and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, this installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments. In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits.
And we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products, with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year over year and in line with our expectations.
There were three key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds.
At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research. iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year over year despite significant FX headwinds.
This performance was driven by two key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers.
In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year over year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record, thanks to the largest number of customers new to a smartwatch that we ever had in a given quarter.
In fact, nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total, and for many services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago.
We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each setting a new all-time record. Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely.
We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly four times what we had just five years ago. And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season.
Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Turning to the enterprise market. we are seeing continued adoption of our services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay, and Apple Financial Services.
For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process. Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position.
We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion.
As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time. As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter.
This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of five percentage points. For services, we expect revenue to grow year over year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance.
For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year over year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds. We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect opex to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.
Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance
Thank you, Luca. [Operator instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward? Thanks.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.
In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from three countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.
I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. And I think it's -- I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate. In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.
David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance
Great. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.
Shannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margin. The guidance especially of 43.5% to 44.5% is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things.
And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.
Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer
Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now.
In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%.
We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating.
The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.
Shannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Thank you. And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China? What you're seeing -- obviously, you've had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese or in Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying? And how are you thinking about your position there?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant -- the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously, the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country also impacted the demand during the quarter. When you look at the opening that started happening in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to November.
And that followed through to demand as well. And I don't want to get into January. We've obviously -- for January is included in the guidance or the color rather that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.
Shannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Thank you.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance
Great. Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.
Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year over year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points.
And so I guess my two questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change.
Two, correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year over year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us.
For example, India and Brazil as just two examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.
Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for that, Tim. And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand structuring and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year-ago quarter.
Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that. In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down.
And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it. In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color.
Erik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yeah. That's great. Thanks so much.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance
Thanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question.
Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line.
Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as may be benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point.
Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included.
And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance.
And so obviously, components are a big part of that.
Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Yep. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yep. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG.
I mean these things have literally save people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product in every service that we have.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance
Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.
Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around.
But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down toward the lower-end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.
Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in services, what do you think drives the growth more? So is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those two buckets as you go forward?
Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer
Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. It's the engine for services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers.
So that's incredibly important. The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future.
And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time. The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants.
And so obviously, payment services are -- continue to set new highs all the time for us. And as we've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our Services business.

Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey. Tim,I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India.
Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020.
We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.
We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those two markets.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. I -- we don't know at this point exactly what that will be, but we're all in, in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona. I'm very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
OK. Fair enough. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yep.

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thank you. Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice toward higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
The Pro has been a -- 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them -- couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations and the product speak for themselves.
And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.
Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us -- the iPhone has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and -- for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.
Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
OK. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base?
Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer
Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last seven years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform.
That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets.
We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last seven years.
So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time.
Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance

Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Arete Research LLP.
Tejas Gala -- Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance
Operator, can we move on to the next?
Operator
Richard? OK. Next we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. If you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.
Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst
Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID. We've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher-speed transmissions.
And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk, not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever? And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoots of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past two years? Thank you, gentlemen.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there.
We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.
Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst
Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on services? Thank you.
Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial Officer
It was -- Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily the -- this level of engagement we saw, which then reflects into the, as you said, the paid subscriptions. We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Music was very strong.
So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago.
So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.
Jim Suva -- Citi -- Analyst
Thank you so much and congratulations to you and all your teams.

Our next question will come from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two.
The first one, Tim and Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften, and it has an impact. And as consumers tighten their belt, we look across your hardware products and service businesses. Where are you seeing the biggest impact? And where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the Mac.
The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also. How do you think about the Mac relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
The industry is very challenged, as you say. It's -- the industry is contracting. I think from us, though, is -- and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year. But over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable sized market, a big market.
And we have low share, and we have a competitive advantage with Apple silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well-positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thanks a lot, Tim.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yep.

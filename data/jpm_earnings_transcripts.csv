JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.10%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallJan 15, 2025, 8:30 a.m. ET
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results.
When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 959% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.
They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…
*Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025
The firm reported revenue of 43.7 billion, up 3.8 billion or 10% year on year. NII ex-markets was down 548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances. NIR ex-markets was up 3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees.
And markets revenue was up 1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of 22.8 billion were down 1.7 billion or 7% year on year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation, as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.4 billion and a net reserve of 267 million.
On Page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year. I'll remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of 54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of 173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year.
In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and securities services. And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of 234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4.
We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The 24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. CCB reported net income of 4.5 billion on revenue of 18.4 billion, which was up 1% year on year.
In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 7% year on year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year on year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In home lending, revenue was up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue.
Turning to card services and auto. Revenue was up 14% year on year, largely driven by card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolve growth. And in auto, originations were 10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new vehicle inventory.
Expenses of 9.7 billion were up 4% year on year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.1 billion, up 428 million year on year, driven by card. The net reserve build was 557 million, predominantly driven by higher card revolving balances. Next, the commercial and investment bank on Page 6.
CIB reported net income of 6.6 billion on revenue of 17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41% and benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors.
Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was 4.7 billion, up 3% year on year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was 1.9 billion, up 9% year on year, predominantly driven by lower losses on hedges.
Moving to markets. Total revenue was 7 billion, up 21% year on year. Fixed income was up 20%, with better performance in credit, as well as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity in derivatives amid increased volatility and higher trading volumes in cash.
Securities services revenue was 1.3 billion, up 10% year on year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of 8.7 billion were up 7% year on year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. Global corporate and investment banking loans were down 2% quarter on quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations.
In commercial banking, middle market loans were also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. And commercial real estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year on year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were 61 million, driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, offset -- largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions.
Then to complete our lines of business, asset and wealth management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of 1.5 billion, with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of 5.8 billion was up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of 3.8 billion were up 11% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees.
Long-term net inflows were 76 billion for the quarter, positive across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of 94 billion for the quarter and 104 billion for the full year -- 140 billion for the full year, sorry. And we had client asset net inflows of 468 billion for the year. AUM of 4 trillion and client assets of 5.9 trillion were both up 18% year on year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels.
And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 5% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of 1.3 billion. Revenue of 2 billion was up 223 million year on year.
NII of 2 billion was down 415 million year on year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a net loss of 30 million, compared with a net loss of 668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of 550 million were down 3 billion year on year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of 2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on Page 9.
We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately 90 billion. Going through the drivers. As usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 2024.
You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth. We expect healthy card loan growth again this year but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits. Firmwide deposits have stabilized, and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025.
It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth, as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect firmwide NII to be approximately 94 billion as a function of markets NII increasing to about 4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR.
Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about 95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently.
The largest increase is volume- and revenue-related expense, which is primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers and advisors to support business growth, as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven as we continue to invest in new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization.
Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our card business. And finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure; and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now, let's turn to Page 11 to cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we expect the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%.
So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios.
Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees. We are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees, as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A. 
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's premature what I'm about to do. But I just want to say I'd be -- and I'd be remiss not to say that he's a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading, and then became a co-head of the investment bank and the sole head of the investment bank for 10 years.
Over that whole time, you know, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world. And so -- and then, obviously, was the president for five years or more, a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So, we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Great. All right. So, let's go to questions.
Operator
Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.
John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus, you know, your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.
John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Thank you.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
So, John, read your theme the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work.
John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make, so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have, you know, a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it, you know, at better levels, essentially, in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so, that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us.
Having said that, you know, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough -- you know, we have enough excess. And given that, you know, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near-term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although I'll give the caveat that, as you know, it's in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.
John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
OK. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or the last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing, that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high-certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. You know, the execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities.
You know, in the commercial and investment bank, we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significant -- significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. You know, Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So, we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But broadly, the themes are very consistent.
I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is when we think about efficiency and how we've generated at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so, that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have, you know, a few top-down areas of focus.
I think if I go, for example, in technology, for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development. And there's been a lot of focus on that, the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive. And so, all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization, and so that's embedded in there as well.
And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that at Investor Day, excuse me, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. Now, as Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and that it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also, in some sense, a form of efficiency.
Finally, though, what I would say is that, you know, if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot, and it's been for very good reasons, and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth, as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So, we're going to try to run things with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second on roughly flat headcount and have that lead to people generating, you know, internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things.
The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high-certainty investment and growth, so obviously branches and bankers and so on; and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So, that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.
John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thank you.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
[Inaudible] said.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, you know, how -- why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, all 15 years of your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and the regulatory costs.
And it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so, and what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury secretary. It seems like your work is your hobby, right? So, how much longer would you stay around?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me.
It's about the other senior people at the company. It's about the board. If I'm here for several more years -- and, you know, I may or may not be chairman of that, it's going to be up to the board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? Now, you're talking potentially four or five years or more.
I'm 60 -- I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple of health problems you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense.
And so -- and what was your first question again?
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
Who's your successor? I mean [Inaudible]
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. You look -- you, guys -- I mean, this is -- look, this is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where, you know, these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and all the toing and froing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them.
There may be one or two you don't know. The board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jen Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as chief operating officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's willing to work with those people, which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership.
And it'll be one of those people. And, you know, obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And, you know, of course, at the last minute, you know, a couple of years from now, people get sick, they change their mind, they have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yup. Basic case, yeah.
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, you know, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new soon-to-be -- I guess a new head of regulation at the Fed.
So, maybe just talk about again what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something worth thinking about a lot, but, you know, I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, you know, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity.
It uses data, and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of the safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth. And the hope is that, you know, we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get, you know, a little bit less bureaucratic and a little bit less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that, you know, at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether a capital goes up, down, stays flat, it's really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame.
It's also G-SIB. It's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly, with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
That's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important.
There's been a lot of recognition that what counts with liquidity and discount windows and how LCR has done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what do you want out of the banking system? And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, balkanized system we built, which has negatives. And even the regulators will tell you that.
So, you know, at one point, just take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing, have -- and continue to have the best financial system in the world.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
Yup. That makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth, have you -- since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a good question, and I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets, you know, and healthy balance sheets and small businesses and maybe some residual caution.
And maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near term. But we'll see what the new year brings as, you know, the current optimism starts getting tested with reality one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth, in particular.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.
Erika Najarian -- Analyst
Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator.
So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that -- you know, somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50 basis points, you know, two years and one day from now. At the same time, you know, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks in terms of the transparency. You know, it's -- it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.
So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7 is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of, you know, two big components? Clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Right, Erika. OK. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. Let's try to address this not at too much great length.
First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter to fourth quarter. So, while our current view of the G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket, just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types.
So, that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal pattern. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, you know, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%.
OK. You mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that, you know, we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the, you know, non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great.
I think -- you know, I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is what is our core view about -- and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment? And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5 numerator, up 10 numerator, up 20 numerator -- I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less -- and then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess.
And, you know, as you point out, at 15.7, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like 275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.

And just as a follow-up question -- follow-up to John's line of questioning, as a placeholder, as we think about what you said trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that, you know, anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7 will be bought back, you know, buy the company as we think about -- I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, you've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
But we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. I mean, you all know that everyone is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake.
Operator
Does that conclude your question, Erika?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yup.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. OK.
Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst
Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially overearning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically in the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple of different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right.
If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve playing out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen, but, you know, if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And, you know, you could draw the conclusion that that means that, you know, the overall earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that, in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field. The current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being, anyway, you know, when we do the math, that's what we see.
Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
We've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it is worth noting that, you know, NII ex-markets is down year on year, so there's some amount of normalization coming.
Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst
OK. And then just separately, a strategic question, there's been some reports about you further expanding the consumer banking business globally, and I guess I just want to, you know, push on that where, you know, we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering, like, you know, is it worth it.
Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risks of doing global consumer banking?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, I think you've kind of answered your own question in the sense, like, you know, we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative, and I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. And that's not to say that, like, we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment.
So, you know, it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And, you know -- but pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.
And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively, you know, through all of our management processes.
Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Betsy.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Can you hear me OK? All right. I just want to make sure you can hear me. So, this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter.
It's been a great call, with a lot of robust questions here. You're, like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook, and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan -- but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to the -- could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, you know, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around, you know, you've got the green market share No. 1, you've got the yellow, you've got the red places maybe we can't see, could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are -- you know, where they are? Are they just scattered? Everybody's -- every single business has one.
Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think -- you know, looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of frankly that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a function of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there.
Now, that's -- those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long. So, you know, whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue. But as we -- as you can see, like, in our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, you know, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be -- it's decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite.
It's still growing above trend obviously, which is great and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know, you know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind, you know, in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism.
Could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes, but I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right, and they're aligned with our big, long-standing investment strategies.
The biggest single one arguably is that in, you know, the -- what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space. We are significantly underpenetrated relative to, you know, the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but, you know, we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business, inside investment banking, and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great, in any given region, in any given subsector, we can do better.
And as I mentioned, you know, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Betsy.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst
Good morning. I guess just two questions in terms of areas of vulnerability. So, I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents, like if we anchor to the fact that the administration that's taking place are going to take office with a focus on domestic capex. Even if we don't get any rate cuts, when you look through your customer base, where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, we'd love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Oh, I see what your question is. That took me a second. Yeah. I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict.
It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You know, you obviously know that we -- we're coming out of a 10-plus-year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate. And so, at some point, that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, to -- a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio -- of the portfolio to rate shock.
A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you know, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to, you know, go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I just want to add, the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment that's both on the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, subprime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, you're going to have to make your own, which will determine that over time.
And so, the second thing you said is vulnerabilities. You know, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. You know, I'm not -- we're not predicting that, but you just ask where the vulnerability is.
That's the vulnerabilities.
Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst
And I guess -- thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on how -- when the Fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit growth?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete; and therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H8 data and our kind of flow-of-funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our ARPU is behaving, evolution of QT expectations for, you know, economywide loan growth, etc., and what the impact of that might be on the growth of systemwide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about our sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, you know, plus or minus what happens with the policy rate, and, you know, stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.
Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst
Good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question is -- comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy, you mentioned --
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
You mentioned in your comments about the overall firmwide deposits have stabilized; and in second half, you could see some growth and you've already -- I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running at about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you -- based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
That's fascinating, Gerard. I'll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things.
So, of course, there was some excess and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So, you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen.
In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring a lot of new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So, you know, the combination of the tail end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in these sort of organic build-out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share with us the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective, not so much from an investor? But we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital.
But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, Jamie, he made some public comments on this at a conference some time back, so he'll -- if he wants to go. So, go ahead.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Go ahead. Jeremy, go ahead.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
No, seriously.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know. But most people don't want it.
It doesn't enhance shareholder value. And I -- I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at life like you have to ""deploy capital."" So, we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special, they really basically don't work.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Very well.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
If anyone has a different opinion, you know, we're always interested.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation.
The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum.
Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37, and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked No.
When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 959% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.
They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…
*Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025
1 in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year on year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm wide results.
The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year on year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year on year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year on year, driven by compensation including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.
And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card, and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.
This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year on year.
In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year on year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year on year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network.
In-home lending, revenue was up 3% year on year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year on year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.
And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year on year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year on year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5.
The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals.
Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year on year.
Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year on year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.
Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year on year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation, and growth in place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity.
Average client deposits were up 7% year on year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%.
For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year on year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed-income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion.
AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion.
Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year on year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year on year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year on year.
To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on Page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth-quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense.
And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues.
But we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. 
Operator
Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question.
I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for '25? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve.
So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit.
So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.
And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter.
And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth.
Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
All right. Thanks a lot.

Hi. Good morning. So, Jeremy, hi. How are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light.
I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment.
Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion.
So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation.
But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year.
And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed.
The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
And can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management.
We're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that.
Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things.
And also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time.
Steven Chubak -- Analyst
No. Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities.
We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
More than 6%. So like --
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower.
It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could.
We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.
Steven Chubak -- Analyst
Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Steve.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.
Erika Najarian -- Analyst
My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year over year in '25, consensus has it down 4% from your new level.
So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year over year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness, or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Right, OK. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question.
So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year.
So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth-quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.
So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now --
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Could I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth.
And there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Good. OK. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there.
So as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact.
And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front-end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end.
So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.
Erika Najarian -- Analyst
And if I can ask my second question and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business.
And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that.
So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, etc. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital.
And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.
We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.
The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine.
And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.
Erika Najarian -- Analyst
Thank you.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
And one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.
Glenn Schorr -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers.
We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed-income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side.
Thanks.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical.
I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses.
Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid off, some are done.
So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size.
We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy.
We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider.
That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different.
That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship.
So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.
Glenn Schorr -- Analyst
All right. Thanks for all that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as vice chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr's speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital.
In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
But Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff.
And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed.
So we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are.
Can you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Absolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product.
I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it.
Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst
Very good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst
Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those.
So it's possible that that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi, and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected.
So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
I noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year.
Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst
And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year over year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever.
So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.
So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios.
Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2nd, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed.
Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
I think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy.
So -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job.
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
I think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I'm not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do.
I intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.
Mike Mayo -- Analyst
Let me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued.
And on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Well, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it.
We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices.
And I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending.
Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed-income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech's. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.
Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors.
You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S.
capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied.
But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Can I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well-positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers, and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet.
But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit.
But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it.
We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that.
And so far, we have.
Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst
Got it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September.
Just give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago.
You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a systemwide deposit growth, which gets removed.
And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan.
It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time.
I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again.
I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.
Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you, both.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Hello. Hi. Good morning.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Betsy.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Can you hear me? Hello?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We can hear you. Yes.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Can you hear me OK?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. We can hear you. Can you hear us?
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it.
But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point.
You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR.
But for the [Inaudible] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you --
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Those were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year on year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion.
And as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
OK. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions.
I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
What about --
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
-- creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that.
But put us in a cautious category and credit card by the way, we are -- we don't like stretch.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
I'm just wondering about the private-label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients?
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Almost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label.
I know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible.
So I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance.
Betsy Graseck -- Analyst
Thank you so much.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.
Saul Martinez -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going.
So I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already.
Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high.
And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy.
We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective.
We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression.
And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Absolutely. Agree.
Saul Martinez -- Analyst
OK. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time.
We're very comfortable, very nice business for you all.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Got it. OK, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.
James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Saul.

Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum.
Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of 51 billion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock.
When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 959% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.
They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…
*Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025
Also included is 546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of 13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year on year and 17% quarter on quarter and markets revenue was up 10% year on year.
In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter, we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior-year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter.
Also, in the prior-year quarter, most of the expenses were in corporate, whereas now, they are primarily in the relevant line of business. Now, turning to Page 2 for the firmwide results. The firm reported revenue of 51 billion, up 8.6 billion or 20% year on year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of 2.7 billion, revenue of 43.1 billion was up 3.4 billion or 9%.
NII ex markets was up 568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic-related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was up 7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up 2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses.
And markets revenue was up 731 million or 10% year on year. Expenses of 23.7 billion were up 2.9 billion or 14% year on year. Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were 3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.2 billion and a net reserve build of 821 million.
Net charge-offs were up 820 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. The net reserve build included 609 million in consumer and 189 million in wholesale. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.
As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024.
And finally, the firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of 4.2 billion on revenue of 17.7 billion, which was up 3% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year on year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue.
Average deposits were down 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of 1.3 billion was up 31% year on year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to card services and auto.
Revenue was up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were 10.8 billion, down 10%, coming off strong originations from a year ago while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of 9.4 billion were up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.1 billion, up 813 million year on year, predominantly driven by card as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was 579 million, also driven by card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the commercial and investment bank on Page 5. Our new commercial and investment bank reported net income of 5.9 billion on revenue of 17.9 billion.
You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment, in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior-year quarter.
Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year.
Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year on year as deposit margin compression and higher deposit-related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets. Total revenue was 7.8 billion, up 10% year on year. Fixed income was up 5%, with continued strength in securitized products.
And equity markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record revenue in prime on growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security services revenue was -- of 1.3 billion was up 3% year on year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 9.2 billion were up 12% year on year, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation, legal expense, and volume-related noncompensation expense. In banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year on year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially.
Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year on year and relatively flat sequentially.
Finally, credit costs were 384 million. The net reserve build of 220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were 164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6.
Asset and wealth management reported net income of 1.3 billion, with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of 5.3 billion was up 6% year on year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 3.5 billion were up 12% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were 52 billion, led by equities and fixed income.
And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of 16 billion. AUM of 3.7 trillion was up 15% year on year, and client assets of 5.4 trillion were up 18% year on year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7.
Corporate reported net income of 6.8 billion on revenue of 10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately 450 million year on year. NII was up 626 million year on year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of 1.6 billion were up 427 million year on year.
Excluding foundation contribution, expenses were down 573 million year on year, largely as a result of moving First Republic-related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex markets of approximately 91 billion; adjusted expense of about 92 billion; and on credit, card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%.
So, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.

Please stand by. For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Steve.
Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
So, I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Just given some indications that the fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the G-SIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for for some time, as you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Right. OK, and thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas. So, it's just going to be me today.
OK. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no.
It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that, you know, before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through-the-cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, you know, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually like increase the ROTCE, and I don't really think that answer has, you know, particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading, and, you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here.
But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comment that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio.
But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged. So, I'll review it quickly.
You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend. And in that context, it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally, buybacks.
That hierarchy does not permit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, you know, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.
Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up, on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risks related to NII over-earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures.
Deposit balances were also more resilient in what is a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher and where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. You know, when you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, you know, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that, and RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system.
But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that, you know, there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as, you know, flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those systemwide headwinds. So, you know, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but, you know, I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over-earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is, you know, just the change in the fed outlook.
So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But, you know, obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes. And in the end, we're kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over-earning, whatever it is.

Next, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Saul Martinez -- HSBC -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the fed's calculation due to OCI.
Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher, and if you can give us a sense of what that process looks like?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the fed. You know, the -- not to confirm or deny that they even exist. You know, that stuff is private.
And, you know -- so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released, the 3.3%, is a preliminary number. By rule, the fed has to release that by August 31st. It may come sooner. You know, you talked about an error in the calculation.
We haven't used that word. You know, what we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the fed's disclosed results looked not intuitively high to us, and, you know, if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you know, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and, you know, we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms.
And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage the capital of a bank, it leads to excessively high management buffers, and, you know, we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that.
Saul Martinez -- HSBC -- Analyst
OK. Got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns, you know, on Steve's question, you know, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if.
And, you know, obviously, Jamie is not there. You know, you can't speak for Jamie. But it seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for, you know, a special dividend or, you know, buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of, you know, how you're thinking about the various options, any updated thoughts on your special -- on a special dividend, and can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase where, you know -- and keep that flat and grow into that -- grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, you know, Jamie's comments at the industry conference where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into a good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference.
You know, we hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing. And he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, to your -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're, you know, looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth.
And then, you know, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment. So, that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it's buybacks. And, you know, Jamie has been on the record for, you know, over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters talking about, you know, how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and, you know, price is a factor.
So, that's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess.
Saul Martinez -- HSBC -- Analyst

Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, you know, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, you know, up sequentially and 50% year over year. And I saw you on the tape earlier, just talking about, you know, still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space, and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again.
I'm just wondering, you know, just where you feel the environment is, you know, relative to the potential and just, you know, where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. You know, people have been talking about the depressed banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base but also a nice sequential improvement.
So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, you know, as I -- the dialogue on ECM is elevated, and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space.
But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward; and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity, as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well.
And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. You know, on ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by a few stocks. The sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance.
Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, you know, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds. That's an issue. You know -- and while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, you know, people still have concerns about that.
So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time, that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yeah, on the advisory side, you know, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side? Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days, you know, pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Any -- is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still -- it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations.
You know, as I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohorts, inside the income cohorts. And, you know, when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of, you know, behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower-income segments where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into nondiscretionary, but the effects are really quite subtle and, in my mind, definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they'd been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you know, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all kind of hangs together in what is, in some sense, actually, not a very interesting story.

Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussion so far around private credit and you all -- your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of that discussion has been about the direct lending component.
So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business, so I'd appreciate your thoughts there? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that, as you know, a lot of money has been raised, you know, in private credit funds looking for deals.
And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, you know, at this point, you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer, you know, best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including, you know, secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there.
I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in this space, so to speak. And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing, so I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
No, that's great for you if you're not hearing much about it so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing on you were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great. We know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high.
And I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Right. I mean, on duration, you know, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, you know, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter.
But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, you know, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that, empirically, we've behaved like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the EAIR-type lens, the short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front.
Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if, you know, extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in, you know, 5.5% rates. In fact, you know, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of mind for us.
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Good morning. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on, you know, essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20 and more normalized at 17. Obviously, you've pointed to over-earning on net NII. And I guess the question is, is that all of it to go from 20 to 17? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs, or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like, you know, our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about fourth quarter, like better to look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns and the quarterly numbers.
And you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's -- you know, we've talked about that.
Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And, you know, in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have like expenses growing -- revenues growing at some organic GDP-like rate may be higher and expenses growing at a similar or slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you know, you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen.
So, as much as, you know, our discipline on expense management is, you know, as tight as it always has been, there -- inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still, you know, higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, you know, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far.
So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at, you know, the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also, you know, how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.
Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because, right now, the yield curve is inverted? Maybe you're still, you know, bleeding in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect a little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what do you mean by that? Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before. I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean? Like -- I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of Treasury supply dynamics, you know, people's thinking on that may be changing.
But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But, you know, when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive fed tightening, you know, it's just a timing issue, and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspective. So, there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be, you know, sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But, you know, that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.
Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the over-earning narrative, and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list, and what would cause you to end the over-earning narrative?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
No, actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the over-earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is this through-the-cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you've talked about, and the single most important piece is the deposit margin.
You know, our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over-earning narrative.
Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Your 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE kind of expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
I mean, we would generally assume, you know, requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller, a little bit bigger, and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on, you know, SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars. And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and, obviously, things like G-SIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done, you know, a bunch of scenario analyses along the lines of what I did in Investor Day that informs those numbers, but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why, at Investor Day, when we talked about it, you know, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.
Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, you know, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital, and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these, you know, things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time, or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, you know -- and we've talked about this a lot, and Jamie has talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken. And 17% is like an amazing number, actually.
And, you know, like to be able to do that given how robust the competition is from banks, from nonbanks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in is something that we're really proud of. So, you know, the number has a range around it obviously, so it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate. But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again assuming the reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.
But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and client segments.
Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Betsy.
Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's 4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And I mean, I understand it's a function of, OK, how much do we organically grow. You know, but even with that -- so you get the organic growth, which, you know, you had some nice movement there.
But you do the organic growth, and then, you know, is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings, or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And, you know, I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but, you know, we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about -- how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, that's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs, actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks.
So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief, and so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.
But having said that -- I mean, nonetheless, try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely, unless, you know, the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when, for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely, but I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your organic capital. And so, you know, we were talking before about this 2 billion pace.
We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from. Let's put it that way. You talked about the 4.9, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number, but where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made that we have these, you know, significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, you know, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large-cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock.
And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock? So, we talked about -- Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter. So, that is why the 4.9 is a little higher, and it's consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And, you know, beyond that, what you're left with is my answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, you know, when we're generating these types of earnings and there's this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, you know, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary.
So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel that now is the right time.

Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi, Jeremy. How are you?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances, the noninterest-bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter to quarter versus prior quarters when they've steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of, you know, the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that noninterest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period end.
The period-end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn't focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., you know, quarter-on-quarter change and average noninterest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big-picture question, which is what do we expect -- I mean, how are we thinking about ongoing migration of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and as -- and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen.
So, if you think about it, you know, in the wholesale space, you know, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in noninterest-bearing accounts, and over time, for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen; and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And, you know, that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our wealth management business.
And, you know, some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, etc. across our various franchises. So, big picture, I do think that migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now.
But yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.

Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the commercial real estate office. One -- and you always talk about, you know, over-earning on net interest income. Of course, one of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment.
And I know your numbers are still quite low, but they're -- in the corporate investment bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in nonaccrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, we're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day.
If I remember correctly, I think the C&I charge-off rate over the preceding 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, you know, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that.
But, you know, in any given quarter, you know, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I will say.

Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is 10.7 billion.
Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and, you know, try to sort of triangulate if that 10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in card?
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance to build and the card allowance, so we're talking about card specifically, we expected something like 2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but, you know, it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, you know, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front.
So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is, you know, how to reconcile that build to the 12%, you know, growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization in revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.
Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Erika.

And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book.
So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year over year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand, and is there further opportunities to grow that? And then secondly, outside of cards, loan demand has been quite weak, and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically, you know, client activity, primarily secured financing-related, sort of matched book repo-type stuff and similar things that are -- gross up the balance sheet quite a bit but are quite low risk and, therefore, quite low RWA intensity.
So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and is very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients, it's not really particularly RWA and, therefore, capital-intensive and, therefore, doesn't really reflect, you know, an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted, you know, everywhere, except card. Our card business is, of course, in no way capital-constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense.
And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that, but it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, you know, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into, you know, lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, you know, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and, you know, assessing economic risk rationally. And frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now.
When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient, that's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.
Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
Right. OK. Great. Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer

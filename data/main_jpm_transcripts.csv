JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.71%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallJan 15, 2025, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. The firm reported revenue of 43.7 billion, up 3.8 billion or 10% year on year. NII ex-markets was down 548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances. NIR ex-markets was up 3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees.And markets revenue was up 1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of 22.8 billion were down 1.7 billion or 7% year on year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation, as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.4 billion and a net reserve of 267 million.




 On Page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year. I'll remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of 54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of 173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and securities services. And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of 234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The 24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. CCB reported net income of 4.5 billion on revenue of 18.4 billion, which was up 1% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 7% year on year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year on year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In home lending, revenue was up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue.




 Turning to card services and auto. Revenue was up 14% year on year, largely driven by card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolve growth. And in auto, originations were 10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of 9.7 billion were up 4% year on year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.1 billion, up 428 million year on year, driven by card. The net reserve build was 557 million, predominantly driven by higher card revolving balances. Next, the commercial and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of 6.6 billion on revenue of 17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41% and benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was 4.7 billion, up 3% year on year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was 1.9 billion, up 9% year on year, predominantly driven by lower losses on hedges.




 Moving to markets. Total revenue was 7 billion, up 21% year on year. Fixed income was up 20%, with better performance in credit, as well as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity in derivatives amid increased volatility and higher trading volumes in cash. Securities services revenue was 1.3 billion, up 10% year on year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of 8.7 billion were up 7% year on year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. Global corporate and investment banking loans were down 2% quarter on quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In commercial banking, middle market loans were also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. And commercial real estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year on year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were 61 million, driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, offset -- largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then to complete our lines of business, asset and wealth management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of 1.5 billion, with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of 5.8 billion was up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of 3.8 billion were up 11% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees.




 Long-term net inflows were 76 billion for the quarter, positive across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of 94 billion for the quarter and 104 billion for the full year -- 140 billion for the full year, sorry. And we had client asset net inflows of 468 billion for the year. AUM of 4 trillion and client assets of 5.9 trillion were both up 18% year on year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 5% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of 1.3 billion. Revenue of 2 billion was up 223 million year on year. NII of 2 billion was down 415 million year on year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a net loss of 30 million, compared with a net loss of 668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of 550 million were down 3 billion year on year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of 2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on Page 9. We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately 90 billion. Going through the drivers. As usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 2024.




 You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth. We expect healthy card loan growth again this year but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits. Firmwide deposits have stabilized, and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth, as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect firmwide NII to be approximately 94 billion as a function of markets NII increasing to about 4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about 95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume- and revenue-related expense, which is primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers and advisors to support business growth, as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven as we continue to invest in new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization.




 Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our card business. And finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure; and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now, let's turn to Page 11 to cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we expect the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios. Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees. We are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees, as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A. James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 Good morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's premature what I'm about to do. But I just want to say I'd be -- and I'd be remiss not to say that he's a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading, and then became a co-head of the investment bank and the sole head of the investment bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, you know, helped me build one of the great investment banks in the world. And so -- and then, obviously, was the president for five years or more, a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So, we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Great. All right. So, let's go to questions.




 Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus, you know, your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Thank you.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer So, John, read your theme the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Thanks.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make, so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have, you know, a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it, you know, at better levels, essentially, in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so, that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, you know, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough -- you know, we have enough excess. And given that, you know, we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near-term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although I'll give the caveat that, as you know, it's in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst




 OK. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say, last year or the last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing, that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high-certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and those continue to be the main areas of focus. You know, the execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities. You know, in the commercial and investment bank, we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significant -- significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. You know, Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So, we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But broadly, the themes are very consistent.




 I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is when we think about efficiency and how we've generated at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so, that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture, and that remains the case. We do have, you know, a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, in technology, for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development. And there's been a lot of focus on that, the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive. And so, all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization, and so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that at Investor Day, excuse me, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. Now, as Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and that it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also, in some sense, a form of efficiency. Finally, though, what I would say is that, you know, if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot, and it's been for very good reasons, and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently. But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth, as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So, we're going to try to run things with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second on roughly flat headcount and have that lead to people generating, you know, internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things.




 The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high-certainty investment and growth, so obviously branches and bankers and so on; and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So, that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.John McDonald -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Very helpful. Thank you.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 [Inaudible] said.OperatorThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Analyst




 Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, you know, how -- why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, all 15 years of your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and the regulatory costs. And it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so, and what would you do otherwise anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury secretary. It seems like your work is your hobby, right? So, how much longer would you stay around?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me.




 It's about the other senior people at the company. It's about the board. If I'm here for several more years -- and, you know, I may or may not be chairman of that, it's going to be up to the board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? Now, you're talking potentially four or five years or more. I'm 60 -- I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the rational thing to do. I've had a couple of health problems you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense. And so -- and what was your first question again?Mike Mayo -- Analyst




 Who's your successor? I mean [Inaudible]James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You look -- you, guys -- I mean, this is -- look, this is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where, you know, these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and all the toing and froing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There may be one or two you don't know. The board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jen Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as chief operating officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's willing to work with those people, which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of management and leadership.




 And it'll be one of those people. And, you know, obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And, you know, of course, at the last minute, you know, a couple of years from now, people get sick, they change their mind, they have family circumstances. So, even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.Mike Mayo -- Analyst So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 Yup. Basic case, yeah.Mike Mayo -- Analyst All right. Thank you.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, you know, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new soon-to-be -- I guess a new head of regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about again what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something worth thinking about a lot, but, you know, I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, you know, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity. It uses data, and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of the safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth. And the hope is that, you know, we get some of that. And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get, you know, a little bit less bureaucratic and a little bit less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that, you know, at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether a capital goes up, down, stays flat, it's really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame. It's also G-SIB. It's also a number of other factors. And that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly, with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer That's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that what counts with liquidity and discount windows and how LCR has done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what do you want out of the banking system? And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the Byzantine, balkanized system we built, which has negatives. And even the regulators will tell you that. So, you know, at one point, just take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing, have -- and continue to have the best financial system in the world.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Yup. That makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth, have you -- since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a good question, and I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets, you know, and healthy balance sheets and small businesses and maybe some residual caution.




 And maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near term. But we'll see what the new year brings as, you know, the current optimism starts getting tested with reality one way or the other. And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth, in particular.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks.Operator




Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.Erika Najarian -- Analyst Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that -- you know, somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50 basis points, you know, two years and one day from now. At the same time, you know, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks in terms of the transparency. You know, it's -- it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.




 So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7 is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of, you know, two big components? Clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right, Erika. OK. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. Let's try to address this not at too much great length. First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter to fourth quarter. So, while our current view of the G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket, just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various types.




 So, that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal pattern. So, not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, you know, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. OK. You mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that, you know, we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the, you know, non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So, that's great. I think -- you know, I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is what is our core view about -- and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment? And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5 numerator, up 10 numerator, up 20 numerator -- I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less -- and then guessing about our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And, you know, as you point out, at 15.7, and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like 275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.




Erika Najarian -- Analyst And just as a follow-up question -- follow-up to John's line of questioning, as a placeholder, as we think about what you said trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that, you know, anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7 will be bought back, you know, buy the company as we think about -- I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, you've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer But we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. I mean, you all know that everyone is out there modeling these things, trading against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake.OperatorDoes that conclude your question, Erika?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yup.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. OK.




Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially overearning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher rate environment that's expected now or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically in the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple of different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right.




 If you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve playing out in line with the current forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen, but, you know, if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And, you know, you could draw the conclusion that that means that, you know, the overall earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that, in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field. The current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being, anyway, you know, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer We've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it is worth noting that, you know, NII ex-markets is down year on year, so there's some amount of normalization coming.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst OK. And then just separately, a strategic question, there's been some reports about you further expanding the consumer banking business globally, and I guess I just want to, you know, push on that where, you know, we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering, like, you know, is it worth it.




 Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risks of doing global consumer banking?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think you've kind of answered your own question in the sense, like, you know, we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative, and I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. And that's not to say that, like, we're special or anything. It's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So, you know, it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And, you know -- but pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision.




 And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively, you know, through all of our management processes.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Hi. Good morning.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hey, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Can you hear me OK? All right. I just want to make sure you can hear me. So, this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call, with a lot of robust questions here. You're, like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook, and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan -- but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to the -- could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, you know, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around, you know, you've got the green market share No. 1, you've got the yellow, you've got the red places maybe we can't see, could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are -- you know, where they are? Are they just scattered? Everybody's -- every single business has one.




 Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think -- you know, looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of frankly that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance would be acquisition finance because that's been relatively muted as a function of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there. Now, that's -- those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long. So, you know, whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue. But as we -- as you can see, like, in our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, you know, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be -- it's decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite.




 It's still growing above trend obviously, which is great and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know, you know well the state of the mortgage market given rates. Rates are also a headwind, you know, in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism. Could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes, but I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right, and they're aligned with our big, long-standing investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in, you know, the -- what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space. We are significantly underpenetrated relative to, you know, the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but, you know, we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business, inside investment banking, and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great, in any given region, in any given subsector, we can do better. And as I mentioned, you know, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.




Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Betsy.




OperatorThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Good morning. I guess just two questions in terms of areas of vulnerability. So, I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of crosscurrents, like if we anchor to the fact that the administration that's taking place are going to take office with a focus on domestic capex. Even if we don't get any rate cuts, when you look through your customer base, where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, we'd love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no rate cuts might mean.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, I see what your question is. That took me a second. Yeah. I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You know, you obviously know that we -- we're coming out of a 10-plus-year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate. And so, at some point, that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, to -- a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio -- of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you know, you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to, you know, go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add?




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I just want to add, the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment that's both on the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, subprime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, you're going to have to make your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said is vulnerabilities. You know, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. You know, I'm not -- we're not predicting that, but you just ask where the vulnerability is. That's the vulnerabilities.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst And I guess -- thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on how -- when the Fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit growth?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the tapering should sort of complete; and therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H8 data and our kind of flow-of-funds models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our ARPU is behaving, evolution of QT expectations for, you know, economywide loan growth, etc., and what the impact of that might be on the growth of systemwide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about our sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, you know, plus or minus what happens with the policy rate, and, you know, stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Good. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our final question is -- comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.




Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy, you mentioned --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Gerard.




Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst You mentioned in your comments about the overall firmwide deposits have stabilized; and in second half, you could see some growth and you've already -- I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running at about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you -- based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer That's fascinating, Gerard. I'll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things.




 So, of course, there was some excess and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So, you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring a lot of new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So, you know, the combination of the tail end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in these sort of organic build-out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share with us the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective, not so much from an investor? But we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital.




 But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, Jamie, he made some public comments on this at a conference some time back, so he'll -- if he wants to go. So, go ahead.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 Go ahead. Jeremy, go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No, seriously.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know. But most people don't want it. It doesn't enhance shareholder value. And I -- I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at life like you have to ""deploy capital."" So, we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special, they really basically don't work.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very well.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer If anyone has a different opinion, you know, we're always interested.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Gerard.OperatorThank you. And we have no further questions at this time.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you very much. See you next quarter.Operator[Operator signoff]

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.77%)Q3 2024 Earnings CallOct 11, 2024, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37, and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year on year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm wide results.The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year on year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card, and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year on year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year on year, driven by compensation including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.




 And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card, and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year on year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year on year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield-seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year on year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In-home lending, revenue was up 3% year on year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year on year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve.




 And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high-quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year on year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year on year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year on year. Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late-quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year on year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.




 Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year on year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue-related compensation, and growth in place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year on year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long-term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year on year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year on year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed-income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion.




 Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year on year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year on year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year on year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on Page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth-quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense. And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues. But we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. 




 Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question.




 I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for '25? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve. So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit.




 So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter. And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth. Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst All right. Thanks a lot.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks.




OperatorThank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.Steven Chubak -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. So, Jeremy, hi. How are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light.




 I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion.




 So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management. We're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things.




 And also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time.Steven Chubak -- Analyst No. Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer More than 6%. So like --




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.Steven Chubak -- Analyst Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Steve.OperatorThank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.




Erika Najarian -- Analyst My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year over year in '25, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year over year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness, or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Right, OK. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year. So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth-quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now --




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Could I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Good. OK. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there. So as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front-end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts.




Erika Najarian -- Analyst And if I can ask my second question and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 OK. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, etc. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.




 The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine. And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.Erika Najarian -- Analyst Thank you.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer And one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.




Glenn Schorr -- Analyst Hi. Thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed-income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical. I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid off, some are done.




 So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different.




 That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too.Glenn Schorr -- Analyst All right. Thanks for all that.




OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as vice chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today?




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr's speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 But Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a stand-alone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product.




 I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it.Gerard Cassidy -- Analyst Very good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi, and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 I noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year over year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst




 Got it. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Analyst




 Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2nd, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer I think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy.




 So -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job.Mike Mayo -- Analyst So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 I think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I'm not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out.Mike Mayo -- Analyst Let me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued.




 And on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Well, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices.




 And I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst




 Hey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed-income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech's. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.




 Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Can I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well-positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers, and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet. But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit. But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it.




 We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that. And so far, we have.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Got it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September.




 Just give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a systemwide deposit growth, which gets removed.




 And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time.




 I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, both.




OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Hello. Hi. Good morning.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Can you hear me? Hello?




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yes. We can hear you. Yes.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Can you hear me OK?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. We can hear you. Can you hear us?Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it.




 But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR.




 But for the [Inaudible] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Those were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year on year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst OK. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions.




 I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst




 What about --James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer -- creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in a cautious category and credit card by the way, we are -- we don't like stretch.




Betsy Graseck -- Analyst I'm just wondering about the private-label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients?James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Almost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label.




 I know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible. So I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst Thank you so much.




OperatorThank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open.Saul Martinez -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going.




 So I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high.




 And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer.




James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Absolutely. Agree.




Saul Martinez -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time.




 We're very comfortable, very nice business for you all.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Got it. OK, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.James Dimon -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer




 Thanks, Saul.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, everyone. Thank you.Operator

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q2 2024 Earnings CallJul 12, 2024, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of 51 billion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is 546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of 13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year on year and 17% quarter on quarter and markets revenue was up 10% year on year.In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter, we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior-year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter.




 Also, in the prior-year quarter, most of the expenses were in corporate, whereas now, they are primarily in the relevant line of business. Now, turning to Page 2 for the firmwide results. The firm reported revenue of 51 billion, up 8.6 billion or 20% year on year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of 2.7 billion, revenue of 43.1 billion was up 3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex markets was up 568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic-related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was up 7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up 2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses. And markets revenue was up 731 million or 10% year on year. Expenses of 23.7 billion were up 2.9 billion or 14% year on year. Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by compensation, including revenue-related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were 3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.2 billion and a net reserve build of 821 million. Net charge-offs were up 820 million year on year, predominantly driven by card. The net reserve build included 609 million in consumer and 189 million in wholesale. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA.




 As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally, the firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of 4.2 billion on revenue of 17.7 billion, which was up 3% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year on year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of 1.3 billion was up 31% year on year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to card services and auto. Revenue was up 14% year on year, predominantly driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were 10.8 billion, down 10%, coming off strong originations from a year ago while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of 9.4 billion were up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.




 In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.1 billion, up 813 million year on year, predominantly driven by card as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was 579 million, also driven by card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the commercial and investment bank on Page 5. Our new commercial and investment bank reported net income of 5.9 billion on revenue of 17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment, in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year on year and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior-year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year on year as deposit margin compression and higher deposit-related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets. Total revenue was 7.8 billion, up 10% year on year. Fixed income was up 5%, with continued strength in securitized products.




 And equity markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record revenue in prime on growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security services revenue was -- of 1.3 billion was up 3% year on year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 9.2 billion were up 12% year on year, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation, legal expense, and volume-related noncompensation expense. In banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year on year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year on year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were 384 million. The net reserve build of 220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were 164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of 1.3 billion, with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of 5.3 billion was up 6% year on year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 3.5 billion were up 12% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were 52 billion, led by equities and fixed income.




 And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of 16 billion. AUM of 3.7 trillion was up 15% year on year, and client assets of 5.4 trillion were up 18% year on year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of 6.8 billion on revenue of 10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately 450 million year on year. NII was up 626 million year on year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of 1.6 billion were up 427 million year on year. Excluding foundation contribution, expenses were down 573 million year on year, largely as a result of moving First Republic-related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex markets of approximately 91 billion; adjusted expense of about 92 billion; and on credit, card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. So, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. 




 Questions & Answers: OperatorPlease stand by. For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Jeremy.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Steve.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst So, I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Just given some indications that the fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the G-SIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for for some time, as you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. OK, and thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas. So, it's just going to be me today. OK. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that, you know, before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through-the-cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, you know, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually like increase the ROTCE, and I don't really think that answer has, you know, particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading, and, you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here.




 But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comment that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged. So, I'll review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend. And in that context, it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally, buybacks. That hierarchy does not permit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, you know, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up, on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risks related to NII over-earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures. Deposit balances were also more resilient in what is a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher and where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah, interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. You know, when you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, you know, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that, and RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that, you know, there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as, you know, flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those systemwide headwinds. So, you know, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but, you know, I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over-earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is, you know, just the change in the fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But, you know, obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes. And in the end, we're kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over-earning, whatever it is.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Steve.Operator




Next, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead.Saul Martinez -- HSBC -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you think there is an error in the fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher, and if you can give us a sense of what that process looks like?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the fed. You know, the -- not to confirm or deny that they even exist. You know, that stuff is private. And, you know -- so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released, the 3.3%, is a preliminary number. By rule, the fed has to release that by August 31st. It may come sooner. You know, you talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used that word. You know, what we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the fed's disclosed results looked not intuitively high to us, and, you know, if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you know, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and, you know, we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms.




 And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage the capital of a bank, it leads to excessively high management buffers, and, you know, we think it's really not a great way to do things. So, I'll leave it at that.Saul Martinez -- HSBC -- Analyst OK. Got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns, you know, on Steve's question, you know, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when, not if. And, you know, obviously, Jamie is not there. You know, you can't speak for Jamie. But it seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for, you know, a special dividend or, you know, buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of, you know, how you're thinking about the various options, any updated thoughts on your special -- on a special dividend, and can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function increase where, you know -- and keep that flat and grow into that -- grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, you know, Jamie's comments at the industry conference where he participated the week after Investor Day because he went into a good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. You know, we hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing. And he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So, I think the larger point is just that, to your -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're, you know, looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, you know, the dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment. So, that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it's buybacks. And, you know, Jamie has been on the record for, you know, over a decade, I think, over many shareholder letters talking about, you know, how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and, you know, price is a factor.




 So, that's sort of the totality of the set of options, I guess.Saul Martinez -- HSBC -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks a lot.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Saul.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, you know, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, you know, up sequentially and 50% year over year. And I saw you on the tape earlier, just talking about, you know, still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space, and we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering, you know, just where you feel the environment is, you know, relative to the potential and just, you know, where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. You know, people have been talking about the depressed banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop from a low base but also a nice sequential improvement.




 So, that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So, you know, as I -- the dialogue on ECM is elevated, and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull-forward; and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity, as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. You know, on ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect, and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by a few stocks. The sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so, you know, in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds. That's an issue. You know -- and while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, you know, people still have concerns about that.




 So, those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time, that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yeah, on the advisory side, you know, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there, and so we'll just have to see how that plays out.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side? Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days, you know, pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Any -- is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still -- it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in line with expectations. You know, as I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohorts, inside the income cohorts. And, you know, when you look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of, you know, behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower-income segments where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into nondiscretionary, but the effects are really quite subtle and, in my mind, definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we're seeing, which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they'd been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you know, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all kind of hangs together in what is, in some sense, actually, not a very interesting story.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Ken.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussion so far around private credit and you all -- your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of that discussion has been about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your business, so I'd appreciate your thoughts there? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that, as you know, a lot of money has been raised, you know, in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, you know, at this point, you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So, the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer, you know, best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including, you know, secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we're doing a lot more or less in this space, so to speak. And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing, so I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 No, that's great for you if you're not hearing much about it so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing on you were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great. We know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high. And I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. I mean, on duration, you know, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, you know, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter.




 But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, you know, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that, empirically, we've behaved like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the EAIR-type lens, the short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if, you know, extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in, you know, 5.5% rates. In fact, you know, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of mind for us.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Super helpful. Thanks so much for that.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Glenn.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on, you know, essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20 and more normalized at 17. Obviously, you've pointed to over-earning on net NII. And I guess the question is, is that all of it to go from 20 to 17? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs, or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like, you know, our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about fourth quarter, like better to look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns and the quarterly numbers.




 And you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's -- you know, we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And, you know, in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have like expenses growing -- revenues growing at some organic GDP-like rate may be higher and expenses growing at a similar or slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you know, you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as, you know, our discipline on expense management is, you know, as tight as it always has been, there -- inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still, you know, higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, you know, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at, you know, the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also, you know, how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because, right now, the yield curve is inverted? Maybe you're still, you know, bleeding in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect a little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what do you mean by that? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before. I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean? Like -- I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of Treasury supply dynamics, you know, people's thinking on that may be changing.




 But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But, you know, when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive fed tightening, you know, it's just a timing issue, and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspective. So, there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be, you know, sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But, you know, that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. OK. Thank you for the details.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Matt.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the over-earning narrative, and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list, and what would cause you to end the over-earning narrative?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No, actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the over-earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is this through-the-cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you've talked about, and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. You know, our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over-earning narrative.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Your 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE kind of expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer I mean, we would generally assume, you know, requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller, a little bit bigger, and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on, you know, SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars. And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and, obviously, things like G-SIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done, you know, a bunch of scenario analyses along the lines of what I did in Investor Day that informs those numbers, but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why, at Investor Day, when we talked about it, you know, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, you know, would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital, and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these, you know, things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time, or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, you know -- and we've talked about this a lot, and Jamie has talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken. And 17% is like an amazing number, actually.




 And, you know, like to be able to do that given how robust the competition is from banks, from nonbanks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks, and all of the different businesses that we compete in is something that we're really proud of. So, you know, the number has a range around it obviously, so it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate. But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again assuming the reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and client segments.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thank you.




OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst So, I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right, in the slide deck, it's 4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And I mean, I understand it's a function of, OK, how much do we organically grow. You know, but even with that -- so you get the organic growth, which, you know, you had some nice movement there.




 But you do the organic growth, and then, you know, is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings, or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And, you know, I remember over at Investor Day the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but, you know, we are, right? So, I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about -- how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs, actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief, and so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.




 But having said that -- I mean, nonetheless, try to address your point on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely, unless, you know, the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when, for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely, but I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your organic capital. And so, you know, we were talking before about this 2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from. Let's put it that way. You talked about the 4.9, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number, but where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made that we have these, you know, significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, you know, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and a liquid large-cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock? So, we talked about -- Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter. So, that is why the 4.9 is a little higher, and it's consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And, you know, beyond that, what you're left with is my answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, you know, when we're generating these types of earnings and there's this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, you know, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel that now is the right time.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Betsy.




OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, Jeremy. How are you?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances, the noninterest-bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter to quarter versus prior quarters when they've steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of, you know, the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that noninterest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period end.




 The period-end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn't focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., you know, quarter-on-quarter change and average noninterest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big-picture question, which is what do we expect -- I mean, how are we thinking about ongoing migration of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and as -- and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, you know, in the wholesale space, you know, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in noninterest-bearing accounts, and over time, for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen; and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And, you know, that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our wealth management business.




 And, you know, some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, etc. across our various franchises. So, big picture, I do think that migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the commercial real estate office. One -- and you always talk about, you know, over-earning on net interest income. Of course, one of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment.




 And I know your numbers are still quite low, but they're -- in the corporate investment bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in nonaccrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, we're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day. If I remember correctly, I think the C&I charge-off rate over the preceding 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, you know, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that.




 But, you know, in any given quarter, you know, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I will say.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Appreciate the insights, as always. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Gerard.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning. I just had one clean-up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is 10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and, you know, try to sort of triangulate if that 10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in card?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance to build and the card allowance, so we're talking about card specifically, we expected something like 2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but, you know, it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, you know, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front.




 So, who knows what it'll actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is, you know, how to reconcile that build to the 12%, you know, growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization in revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Erika.OperatorAnd for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Hey. Good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year over year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand, and is there further opportunities to grow that? And then secondly, outside of cards, loan demand has been quite weak, and any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically, you know, client activity, primarily secured financing-related, sort of matched book repo-type stuff and similar things that are -- gross up the balance sheet quite a bit but are quite low risk and, therefore, quite low RWA intensity.




 So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and is very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients, it's not really particularly RWA and, therefore, capital-intensive and, therefore, doesn't really reflect, you know, an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted, you know, everywhere, except card. Our card business is, of course, in no way capital-constrained. So, whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that, but it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, you know, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning that we lean into, you know, lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, you know, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and, you know, assessing economic risk rationally. And frankly, that is, in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient, that's a little bit one example of what I was referring to.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Right. OK. Great. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Jim.Operator




And we have no further questions.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Very good. Thank you, everyone. See you next quarter.Operator

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallApr 12, 2024, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter 2024 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $42.5 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a couple of highlights. Firmwide IB fees were up 18% year on year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees. And we have seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB and Wealth Management business.On Page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic, given that going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense, and $668 million of net income. Now focusing on the firmwide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year on year. NII ex Markets was up $736 million or 4% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12% driven by higher firmwide asset management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year on year.




 Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year on year driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $116 million predominantly driven by Card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects, including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy, supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances were still above pre-pandemic levels, and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year. Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year on year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year on year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7% as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year on year driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year on year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%.




 Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 8% year on year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year on year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $825 million year on year predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card largely offset by a release in Home Lending. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will be -- we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as stand-alone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8-K with historical results, including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the reorganization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year on year. IB fees were up 21% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21% driven by fewer large completed deals.




 Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions with debt up 58% and equity up 51%. In terms of the outlook. While we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue, and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year on year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year on year. Fixed income was down 7% driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prior-year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year on year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year on year predominantly driven by lower legal expense. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year on year driven by higher noninterest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year on year with increased IB fees, largely offset by lower Markets revenue compared to a strong prior-year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year on year driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth, net of higher deposit-related client credits.




 Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year on year predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees, including for office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expenses. Average deposits were down 3% year on year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down 1% quarter on quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter on quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and sales activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pre-tax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year on year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5% driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year on year largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation; continued growth in our private banking advisor teams; and the impact of the JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition; as well as higher distribution fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by equities and fixed income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year on year. And client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year on year driven by higher market levels and continued net inflow. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter on quarter and deposits were flat. Turning to Corporate on Page 8.




 Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year on year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year on year driven by the impact of the balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million, compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year on year predominantly driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 9. We now expect NII ex Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business. And as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue-neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter, and it will likely stay around 23% this year, absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged, and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate.




 This is a smaller gap than we've previously observed, and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward, although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income. We're just mentioning this to help with your models. So to wrap up. We're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey toward NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical, and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent, and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way. And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: OperatorThe first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst So a couple of questions here. Just one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR? And also help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so is this suggesting we could be toward the higher end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's -- we have to wait for Basel III endgame reproposal to come through and all that. But are we -- should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. So, Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me personally. I'm thrilled to have you on this call. For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode. And to remind all of us how lucky we are to be here, but Betsy in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20-plus years have been exceptional. So on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back. I'm thrilled to have you here. And so you're asking a pertinent question. So we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we increased the dividend. And if you ask me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like 1/3 of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, etc. I think the far more important question is the 15%. So look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it. That basically will prepare us for the total Basel endgame today roughly.




 The specifics don't matter that much. Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run. But -- and it looks like Basel III endgame may not be the worst case, it will be something less than that. So obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say on the order of $20 billion or something like that. And yes, we're -- we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first. And we pay the dividend, the steady dividend. Build the business. And if we think it's appropriate, to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world and things like that. So waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully, we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also -- it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our CET1, too. So you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings, increase capital -- that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the -- on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now.




 So it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for our shareholders in due course.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well. And just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks, the trajectory. It's $2 billion a quarter.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I'm sorry, $2 billion a quarter.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 OK. Thank you so much, and I appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Excellent. Us too.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. A good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate. So we're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash-sorting? We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume they're in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above 5%, that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where -- even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So it's quite conceivable. And this is actually on the yield curve that we had in the fourth quarter that had six cuts in it, we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So I would say no meaningful change in the trends, and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So I mean, I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly three cuts in it. So it's the current yield curve. It's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration.




 There is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth, which, while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then there's obviously the wildcard of potential product-level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace. And you know this, obviously. But in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product-level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So the error bands here are pretty wide. And we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Right. OK. Great. Thanks for the color.




 Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that The Street might need to build in more reserve growth for the Card growth. You've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, John. So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year.




 And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the SKU and the CECL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine. But we're narrowly just saying that, based on the card loan growth, that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. Got it. And then just a follow-up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion, but revenue-neutral. I guess the obvious thing is there, there's typically an offset in fee income, and you don't guide to that.




 But the idea would be, the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there's some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is this shift between the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop of the Markets balance sheet in the supplement, and these things are all related. So fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold equities on the balance sheet, non-interest bearing, high funding expense, negative for NII; or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So that shifts as a function of the sort of borrower relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I guess just in terms of, Jamie, when you think about the outlook for the economy, would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher for longer, maybe the economy is too strong so don't get any rate cuts. Are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers, where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks Jamie's pointed out, but I'm just getting -- trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 So I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home price dropped, stock price dropped. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out -- not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money. They're still spending it. So whatever happens, the customer's in pretty good shape. And they're -- if you go into a recession, they'd be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books drop, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, etc. And so we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year, look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, etc. So we're in good -- we're OK right now.




 It does not mean we're OK down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being OK in the current time is always true. That was true in '72, it was true in any time you've had it. So I'm just on the more cautious side that how people feel, the confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so everything is OK today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, one thing you projected today based on what -- not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed. But these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen? Like higher rates with this modest recession, etc., then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of that happen is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict a big inflection point in the economy literally in my life or in history.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate, both for JP and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerabilities and issues beyond office CRE? How would you characterize the health of the CRE market?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So I'll put it into two buckets. First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office.




 We think the multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve, the whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%. All assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. But it's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and filling things out. And other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well, that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies. You are going to have more companies cutting back. You are going to have less leases. It will affect -- including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that people haven't really experienced since 2010. So I'd just put in the back of your mind, the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important.




 If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone -- the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it'd be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all that, but people will muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tougher on a lot of folks, and not just real estate, if in fact that happens.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Helpful. Thank you so much.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III endgame as written. You earn 22% on -- without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or five weeks from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you overearning today?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. So interesting framing of the question, Erika. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're overearning, right? So obviously, one major area is that we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also heard Jamie say that we're overearning in credit. I mean, wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have built for that. So in the current run rate, a bit less clear, the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized, essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So from a bottom-line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on.




 And you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day. So we might not have that much more to say, except to reiterate what I've said in the past, which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize. We will seek to reprice. We will adjust in various ways as to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule, as proposed at least, there -- a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so in the base case, you have to think of it as a headwind.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 Got it. And just as a follow-up question. You mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter? That it seems like the market down-pricing; and obviously no June cut; no September cut; and a toss-up in December, which shouldn't matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, does the -- if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much? Given that it seems like June is the only one that...Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Sorry, Erika. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII.




 So I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EAR, like be my guest. Looks like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you, of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically 0, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors, we've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, etc., etc., etc. So we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions. And it's going to be what it's going to be.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Which we know are going to be wrong.




Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about -- we will have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline to continue to move along. We obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with -- when it relates to M&A on like go, no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then what are you thinking we need to have to kick start just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. Yes. Let me take the IPO first. So we had been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. And I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic, and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so we caution a little bit there about pull-forward, which is even more acute, I think, on the DCM side, given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter. So that's a factor.




 And then the question of M&A, I think, is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A but also because of its knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition financing and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there, and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know. I've heard some narratives that maybe there's like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this. So I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see momentum in announced M&A. Little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic, a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Got it. And I guess I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets. And not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just maybe just talk through some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the fixed income and equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, a really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here? For now, that does seem to be the new normal.




 And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the foreign exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so all of that creates risk management needs, and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth. So I think that those are some of the themes on the Markets side at the margin. And yes, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages, I can see you put a lot of effort into that and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, it's not weeks or months, I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, Consumer or Wholesale Payments. So I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's at a leadership offsite. That's why he was here remote. So I think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse. So -- but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that, right? If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside the U.S. That affects the global economy and therefore the U.S. and therefore our corporate customers, etc., etc. So -- and in that context, keeping in mind what we always say, that we invest through the cycle, that we sort of go -- we don't go into countries and then leave countries, etc. Obviously, we adjust around the edges. We manage risks.




 We do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had, which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. It's -- we're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yes, I'm sure we'll give you more color and other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Just as a follow-up to that, then. Why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else, why is Wholesale Payments doing great?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Well, I think one of the things about payments businesses is that, in some sense, they're -- I mean, recession-proof is probably the wrong word. And in any case, we're not dealing with a recession, but we're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world. And that's a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what. So that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that our willingness to invest, which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so we are seeing the benefits of that.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 All right. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mike.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term and this year. I have a bigger-picture question in terms of you're so good in spelling out where you're overearning. Do you feel like you're underearning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, look, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yes the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So is that -- is there just a bigger upside, and it's just a matter of when, not if?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Glenn, in short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're underearning in Investment Banking now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet. But as you know, at this point, it was like March 2020, right, it was the beginning of the pandemic. So it's like four years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to grow with that. So I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think, particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there. And yes, so that's why we're sort of leaning in.




 We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision an environment -- or maybe I should rephrase that. What type of environment would have JPMorgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. And it's a little bit hard to see it. And in our world, where we're guiding to, I guess now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that are being generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA in the company. That does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think, to get to the heart of your question, which is, OK, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So if you talk about like a normal recession with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans, which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective, assuming resilience through the cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that, for whatever reason, change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason.




 I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short term.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Awesome. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we did see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year over year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter. But maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept that's kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability, at least in theory, to deploy portions of that with kind of like -- into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason in what might be thought of as a tactical sense.




 So he's just pointing out that, that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue. There's just too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is that higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to a higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G-SIB capacity utilization, etc., in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue. We go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it, and we will. So we still are operating under multiple binding constraints, and obviously, the environment is complex. So the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position, which is in no small part in anticipation of all of the uncertainty. But it does also mean that, if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III endgame is final, we are very well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. And then just separately, within the consumer card businesses, you highlighted volumes are up 9% year over year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that, that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category -- either overall or among certain segments?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways, inflation cohorts, etc.




 But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the -- while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest-income cohorts, within that, there's obviously a probability of distribution, and there's some -- or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some such people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit, unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared, which is sort of aggressive levering up. So I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the read-across is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets. And that's sort of at the margin good news from a credit perspective.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thank you very much.




OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, Jeremy.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Gerard. How are you doing?Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course, Jamie talked about it in the shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share -- or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world.




 And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets, and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they're exceptionally tight. So I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would have had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening that -- in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool. And you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms, which always makes us a little bit concerned.




 And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that away from the leveraged lending space, in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, we were seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived the last few weeks, and it's always a little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly the dynamics or the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive, and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst And I guess as a tie-in to that question and answer. We've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there as both as a competitor but also as a client of JPMorgan, how you balance the two out? Where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like, but at the same time, you're supporting their business.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. Yes. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, now you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that, that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas. And that's part of the franchise, and it's all good at some level. But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product-agnostic, actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? What does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silos. So you have -- you need underwriting skills, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do, and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk.




 And so in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. At the same time, the syndicated lending space, being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution, other aspects of how that business works. So we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none. And so we're looking forward to the future here.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Appreciate the color. Thank you.




OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a home run, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter.




 Now I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that? Because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million, down from $900 million. And then secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less, and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So that's my first question.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic-specific guidance. But I do think that kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion, which was very front-loaded as a result of short-dated assets. So that's part of the reason that you see that converge.




 Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full-year perspective, you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There was maybe an embedded question then there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet, and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectation for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumed that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal, including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So yes, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst As a quick follow-up, where are the next home runs going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan. But there's probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for roll-ups of failed banks. And then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So where -- do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So that's my question.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Right. OK, Charlie, there's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. Like you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. Like as we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store. And right now, we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise, despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well-positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude toward different types of bidders. And obviously, there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal, for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess that's probably as much as I have on that.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q4 2023 Earnings CallJan 12, 2024, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and 743 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, 890 million on expense, and 647 million of net income. Now, focusing on the firmwide fourth-quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of 38.1 billion was up 2.5 billion or 7% year on year.NII ex markets was up 2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex markets was up 139 million or 1%, and markets revenue was up 141 million or 2%. Expenses of 23.6 billion were up 4.6 billion or 24% year on year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit cost were 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of 2.2 billion and a net reserve build for 474 million. Net charge-offs were up 1.3 billion, predominantly driven by card and single name exposures in wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in card and the deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the commercial bank. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and revenue of $162 billion.




 And we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains, and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds toward the proposed Basel III endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year on year, driven by strong account growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of 4.4 billion on revenue of 17 billion, which was up 8% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was up 6% year on year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with average balances down 8% year on year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In home lending, revenue was up 230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII. Moving to card services and auto, revenue was up 8% year on year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were 9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of 8.7 billion were up 10% year on year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees primarily in bankers, advisors and technology, and wage inflation as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs, which were up 791 million year on year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card.




 The net reserve build of 538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB on Page 6. The CIB reported net income of 2.5 billion on revenue of 11 billion. Investment banking revenue of 1.6 billion was up 13% year on year. IB fees were also up 13% year on year, and we ended the year ranked No. 1 with a wallet share of 8.8%. In advisory, fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior-year quarter with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was 2.3 billion, up 10% year on year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to markets. Total revenue was 5.8 billion, up 2% year on year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue and rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash.




 Securities services revenue of 1.2 billion was up 3% year on year. Expenses of 6.8 billion were up 4% year on year predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were 210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of 121 million and a net reserve build of 89 million. Moving to the commercial bank on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of 3.7 billion was up 7% year on year, largely driven by higher NII where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of 2 billion was up 2% year on year, driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of 924 million was up 32% year on year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of 1.4 billion were up 9% year on year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year on year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients continue to opt for higher-yielding alternatives and flat quarter on quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were 269 million, including net charge-offs of 127 million and a net reserve build of 142 million, driven by a deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and wealth management reported net income of 925 million with pre-tax margin of 28%.




 Revenue of 4.7 billion was up 2% year on year driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances, partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of 3.4 billion were up 11% year on year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were 12 billion, positive across equities and fixed income and 140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of 49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of 242 billion for the full year. And we have record client asset net inflows of 489 billion for the year. AUM of 3.4 trillion and client assets of 5 trillion were both up 24% year on year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, and deposits were up 7% quarter on quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of 689 million. Revenue of 1.8 billion was up 597 million year on year. NII of 2.5 billion was up 1.2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of 687 million, compared with a net loss of 115 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of 3.4 billion were up 3 billion year on year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on Page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex markets to be approximately 88 billion.




 Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in card to continue but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full-year guidance of approximately 88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in markets NII, which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on this slide, we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll hear more at investor day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firm line drivers.




 Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about 400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes: bankers, branches, advisors, technology, as well as marketing. Net-net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as a result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects on inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed, both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to Page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with investor-day guidance. So, in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were overearning as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path toward normalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities.And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. 




 Questions & Answers: OperatorPlease stand by. For our first question, it's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium-term outlook that you've put out there?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I'm not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. And I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the overearning, so not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlighted on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full-year guidance of 88, that implies obviously exiting below 88 and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that 80. Whether we ever get to the 80 or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 OK. And then just separately, you bought back a couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Good question. And I think you've framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest pace of buyback, consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Thanks, Matt.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions? And how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate and the number is still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously, you can see that skew and the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6 peak off the current levels.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. And then just a follow-up on the NII. Could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts, like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts? And how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EAR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q, but on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower.




 So, I think something like 1.9 as opposed to 2.1. So, just round number is about 2 billion in EAR. I think empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the line effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think you -- as I noted, we do remain asset sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that. And hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. Thanks. 




OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits. Can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Both good questions. So, let's just -- let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs and wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher just even in a world with six cuts. And, you know, that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little nonintuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with like change rates and change in rate pay that gets a little bit nonintuitive.And then in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year continues. And that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rate. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin a little bit more supportive for systemwide deposit balances. And then obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Right. OK. Thanks a lot.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. 




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey, good morning. I guess maybe one question. Looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear -- I'm not sure if Jamie's on the call, but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around, do you believe that the outlook for soft landing has increased as the market pricing incorrectly? Or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lag effects of the rate hikes?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. OK, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing.




 That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So, whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumers find all of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take, but I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously, we always worry about the scenario, is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst And maybe just taking that a step further there, has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE being filtered into multifamily apartments. You all have a pretty large multifamily exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial retail or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, good question on the multifamily. And the short answer is that for us, it's pretty uncontroversially no, no bleed through. And the reason is that while there is we do -- we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So, it's higher-end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Good. Thank you.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. Your -- on a net basis, net to RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guidepost you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that 2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for B3 finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June DFAST results, you mentioned the SCB, sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Erika, it's a good question, and I understand what you're asking, why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty. And it's kind of a probabilistic cloud in a variety of different factors, but all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients, right? Very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is the buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with a modest pace for now.




 But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the 90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or could the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for '24?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 A little bit of that is in there, yes. So, you would see that we often talk about the volume and revenue-related category. And I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about $1 billion increase in that category year on year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So, the hope and expectation of continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you.Operator




Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year over year. It seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that, I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay? How much of that due to tech? How much of that due to AI, and what are the expected returns to get to that $7 billion pickup? Thanks.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yep, Mike. Thanks for the question. And yeah, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at investor day and between now and investor day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we use on the page and go through each line of business. So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year on year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our card products. And so, that shows off in marketing.




 And as you all know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. You know, I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs, and some of them are much longer term, and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts. We had an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So, as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The commercial bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of adds that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent theme to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers, both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes I think both our very, very strong share position as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.




 Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually pretty consistent across the entire firm even though it's really bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been: new products, features, and customer platforms as well as modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company, both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about the driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. I have a short follow-up. I'm still here.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I asked you this before, and you said you're spending it. You're being careful. You want to see a return on your dollars.




 But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much should AI make a difference? Just a little bit more meat on the tech bones.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point. And I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff, and I'll save that for investor day, if you don't mind. But I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have to reach Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the operating committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So, I think that -- I think of this as being a little bit barbelled where, on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase.




 We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way. It's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Right. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Mike.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Hi, Jeremy. How are you?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker? Or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Gerard. I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 OK. Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook, you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that it hasn't -- QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment.




 I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from systemwide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset hopefully by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so, that's been supportive of systemwide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so, that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's -- the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So -- and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in systemwide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also, I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thank you.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Gerard.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.




Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There's been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there? And how the rate in -- how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM, and DCM?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is, of course, supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps higher and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change. So, sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then M&A, it's a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple of nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024 all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive.




Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. And on the flip side in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down? Or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets to open up even more?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a -- I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C-suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So, there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out.




 The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about capex and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower.Manan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yep.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Hi, thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But now, you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance, and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is how big of a trend is this? How much do you think of it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the environment.




 It's something that we've been watching for some time. We have made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively, both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses but also go head to head with the private credit providers and these types of unitranche structures if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and uncertainty of execution. And we can provide both of our sort of exceptionally strong longtime DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the commercial bank and the CIB with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III end game, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. So, more to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours, too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people and regulators, in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Anything specific on asset-backed? It's an important part of your business, too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we're going to look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 OK, cool. Thank you for that.OperatorAnd for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst




 Thank you. Another question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming because you'll have a full year and '24 First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from 3.7 billion this year to 5 billion to 6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or -- I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjusted rate mortgages that I assume pricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic probably be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at investor day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise.




 Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull-to-par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR from my response to the prior question because that EAR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Just to make sure I understood what you're saying. So, you have NII ex market went from 94 to 88. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic being down as well or up?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer It's kind of matched the day we did it. So, yes, I mean I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, in 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023 as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull-to-par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of -- that pull-to-par happens quite quickly and therefore, probably juice the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then it's just like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst All right. Thank you.OperatorAnd we do have no further questions at this time.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q3 2023 Earnings CallOct 13, 2023, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2023 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum; and their chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call. So before we get into discussions about third-quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world, and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of firmwide legal expense. On Page 2, we have some more detail.




 Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income. Now focusing on the firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year on year. NII ex markets was up $4.8 billion or 28% driven by higher rates and higher revolving balance card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex-markets was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. End market revenue was down $190 million or 3% year on year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year on year primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion predominantly driven by net charge-offs in card and included a $102 million net reserve release driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we'll continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III Endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know the interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large, given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress.




 Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting, and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA. We've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with the GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital buffer. Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SACR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet.




 We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And of course, given the absence of effect to the GSIB flaws, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital reform. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel-compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III end game consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features to discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggest that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth, and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the U.S. economy. So caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, we go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6.




 Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend for customer stable and relatively flat year on year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year on year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year on year driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter on quarter. We ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year on year driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year on year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter on quarter, but they remained down 15% year on year. Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 7% year on year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year on year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And then auto originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year on year as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year on year largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology.




 In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year on year predominantly due to continued normalization of card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next, the CIB on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year on year. IB fees were down 3% year on year, and we ranked No. 1 with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year on year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year on year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1% driven by an increase in financing and trade activity and securitized products as well as improved performance in credit.




 This was predominantly offset by Currencies and emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year on year driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year on year predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were a net benefit of $185 million driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year on year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year on year driven by higher rates and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year on year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year on year largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year on year and 5% quarter on quarter primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in real estate banking as well as lower payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 9. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 31%.




 Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year on year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year on year driven by continued growth in our private banking advisory teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and global shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year on year, and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year on year driven by continued net inflows of higher-margin levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter on quarter, while deposits were down 5% driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year on year. To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion.




 And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. On credit, we now expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5% mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty. And all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration, what's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher for longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable.




 And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year. So that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're going to continue to get very good feedback from the field, and we're capturing money in motion. And so we're seeing the sort of internal migration associated with slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped. And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects. And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 And just as a follow-up, it seems like you've done some securities repositioning in the last couple of quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash in the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I'm sure Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it. And that's been our position for some time. And of course, that's produced good results, and we continue to try to position ourselves. So neither significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. Thanks.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about capital market outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how you're thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection in activity?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know, obviously, the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed, certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing that by the time it happens, you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds, as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum, but obviously, significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds, given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst And just for my follow-up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful color on the slide. So thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And I was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III end game proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks. But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum. And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable. So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses. I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past.




 But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight may no longer make sense. Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So sorry, a bit of a long answer. But then, yes, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.




OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserve release was tied to the change in the central scenario.




 Could you just talk to us, remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year. And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside. We're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number would be sometimes giving you this 5.5% this quarter.




 So it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit. And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected. And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank. But the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel end game. Maybe on the philosophical side, I think Jamie was speaking last month said doesn't -- we don't expect any changes. But at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback.




 Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more toward the worst case outcome play out? Or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a 1,000-page rule proposal, as you know. We've got a big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is a possibility or seem to have forgotten. They simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees.




 So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes and there -- cannot forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically. And hopefully, they'll listen.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room. I meant to say $1 trillion.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah. No, I got that. I got the $1 trillion. Yep, thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 What you're talking about actually put something out on itEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.Ryan Kenny -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggests JPMorgan's overearning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalize next year or earlier on?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. A couple of things. So let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when it's going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rate, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day last -- earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there were some overlaps and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that kind of what does that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about 80 with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we don't know when. But we're just trying to point out that it's a bit lower than the current run rate.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Inside the company, some people think it will happen sooner, i.e., me. Some people think it will happen later, i.e., Jen and Maryann, and Jeremy.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer I wasn't aware I was in that count. I don't know. I don't know.




Ryan Kenny -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks. And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth, given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we were seeing very robust loan growth in card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.




 In auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better. So that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And of course, lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain.Ryan Kenny -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. You may proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Good morning, Jeremy. How are you?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTC number of 22% for the quarter. When you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex First Republic ROE in Consumer and Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit, we get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all these other nonbank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE, even when you take that credit overearning out, what's driving this business profitability at such high levels?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Gerard, I'd say a couple of things there. So first, it's not just credit, it's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about overearning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about. But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to beat effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade-long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty.




 And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments, you and Jamie, about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, are around 28% of total deposits, which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the noninterest-bearing deposits going to interest-bearing? Or is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure. I get your question. It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale. That's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking to earnings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale. And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of systemwide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. My first question is for you. Again, sort of maybe reasking the question a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics and higher for longer, on one hand, your fixed-rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you've been asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do you think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is those -- I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex markets. And we're kind of saying that -- yes, it's not what I meant to say.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer She said $22 billion.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, I didn't hear that. OK. Anyway, model that way. Anyway, so call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion.




 So that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting, actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which our CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother. So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration balances, product-level reprice as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now. And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise. And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle. We're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I would just say quantitative tightening there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect where wholesale, consumer as -- remember also the Fed has the RRP program, which is also sucking money into the Fed directly reducing deposits. That's still $1 trillion, too.




Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex. And I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward-looking. I guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, this change your natural return profile of 17%. Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14 when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for your -- for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, this Basel III end game really harm your natural earnings power and returns.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. OK. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple of pieces in there. So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. So short answer is we're not going to change that number today. But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns. In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right? We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here. OK. So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple of reasons.




 One is we are hoping for changes. Two is once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale. Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level. But that hopefully can mitigate some of it. But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past. So we'll see. And then finally, yes, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things. But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder-disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean. So that's that. And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine. And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively.




 And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do. But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.Operator




Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things of what's going on in the world and the potential impact on markets on crude market, global trade, everything that you mentioned. Sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are heading in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what -- obviously, what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Go ahead, Jeremy. Do you want to start?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were.




 But obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming off a very low base. And so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture, at least currently, looks solid. The sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I would add question, there has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system. And you can't look at -- and of course, it can drive markets and sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but it can't stay like this forever. Between Q2, which you've never had and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factors. So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious.




 And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week. And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems. But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot. And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You're just going to be very cautious where you're facing and like I said, the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out with better products and better services, securely, safely and all those things. And that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise as there are going to be bad times. I don't know how they're coming and where they're coming from, but we keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point. But we'll deal with that, too, when we figure out what to do.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thank you for all that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Glenn.




OperatorThank you, Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic asset sensitivity, TD strategy, money in motion. And I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers. Do you have more digital banking customers and branch customers now? If you can just refresh that? And then a more general question, I guess, the first one for Jeremy, and the second one for Jamie.




 You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend? If you can kind of mark to market your thoughts there as it relates to AI as it relates to maybe weighted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender of the banking industry?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple of weeks ago. And it's interesting to note the sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point about --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The percent who are digital only is much lower than that.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer For sure, for sure, which actually links to the broader point that what -- in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic, through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy, which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment, but that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess, your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender.




 I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean, we're big and very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive. And everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just the competition, we look at it is it's Wells. It was coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously, Marcus, it's Apple. It's Chime, it's Dave.




 It's -- a lot of people coming up with these businesses in different ways. Some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost [Inaudible] which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst As it relates to AI specifically, which is the talk of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now? Or is this simply a moonshot?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data. It's looking at everything in the Internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who is running at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, etc. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, broad marketing, prospecting. And the management team is getting better and better and say, how can we use data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have copilots. They know why even the clients calling us something like that. And so we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yes, of course.




 that's always been true with technology and -- but we'll be quite good at it.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And then lastly, I think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you stand on that?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. No, because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference, we said I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through budget process, etc., etc. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin, there's going to be a little bit of upward --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer First Republic, too, or no?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer That's all now including First Republic. And I think there'll be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure on the margin.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thank you




OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting, not only of operational risk, but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting and market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Can I just answer real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one side of the conversation generally. They say put in your comments. So everyone's going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from Jeremy, and we don't really know. We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. My view it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis, I think, is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 OK. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential impact on liquidity in the Markets business, specifically. Is that a JPM pulling out of certain business type of event? Or is that -- is it more a comment that there'll be fewer providers of liquidity as less-scaled players exit? And maybe that's all else equal, a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think -- so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think, 60% increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product for some products and for others. But generally, it's across all products. And market make-- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function. and if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds. And I don't know what the real intent was, but this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through. What are you trying to accomplish? We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that.




 But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, etc, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because sure, if you want, you can construct as what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller-scale players to exit, and that's a share gain opportunity for us. But I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale. Getting bigger, especially in Markets, it's quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective. And so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides, which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting that it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in markets over the last 15 years is a fundamentally very different system. And well, obviously --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity. Like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Right. That's helpful. Thanks.




OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor -- excuse me, with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst All right. Good morning. You talked about increased spend in some areas in response to an earlier question, but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressure at least on net interest income, a few might help. But the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple of few years.




 So I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control in the next few years?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework, but in some fundamental sense, we just don't agree with the framework in the sense that -- and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally, and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes. But other things are more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that.




 That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays. And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yes. Fair enough. And then if I could just squeeze in on First Republic. Obviously, the contribution there is coming in at multiples higher than expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of -- I think there's probably some runoff of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So you're right about the contribution about the runoff of loans that it is notable the net income, the First Republic-related net income that we printed this quarter. So the first thing to say is that we don't think that, that First Republic-related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly, as I think you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition. And so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yes, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus. And I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yes, I think, as I said, I think, on the press call, things are going well, arguably a little bit better than we had sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. There are no further questions.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q2 2023 Earnings CallJul 14, 2023, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2023 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of 42.4 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25%. These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of 2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio of 1.2 billion, as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Touching on a few highlights. CCB client investment assets were up 18% year on year.We had record long-term inflows in AWM, and we ranked No. 1 in IB fee wallet share. Before giving you more detail on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on Page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule.




 The number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding apace, and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2nd, and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market, we are happy to see that client retention is strong, with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition. Now, turning back to this quarter's results on Page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic, where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter, First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, 599 million of expense, and 2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain, which is reflected in NIR in the corporate segment, as well as 1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue as allowance in CCB, CB, and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and, substantially, all of the expenses are in corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to firmwide results, excluding First Republic. Revenue of 38.4 billion was up 6.7 billion or 21% year on year.




 NII, ex markets, was up 7.8 billion, or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR, ex markets, was down 293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items, primarily in the prior year. And markets revenue was down 772 million or 10% year on year. Expenses of 20.2 billion were up 1.5 billion, or 8% year on year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs of 1.7 billion included net charge-offs of 1.4 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build included a 389 million build in the commercial bank, a $200 million build in card, and a 243 million release in corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter, as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio. And as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9%, versus our current requirement of 4%, and it goes into effect in 4Q '23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter. On liquidity, our bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our earnings-at-risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So, when we release this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100-basis-point parallel shift scenario will be about positive 2.5 billion.




 Whereas, in the absence of the change, it would have been about negative 1.5 billion. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient, and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results, which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB, and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of 16.4 billion, which was up 31% year on year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was up 59% year on year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 4% quarter on quarter as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher-yielding products. Client investment assets were up 18% year on year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and digital channels. In home lending, revenue was down 23% year on year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter on quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year on year. Moving to card services and auto. Revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year on year, which was the result of revolver normalization and strong new account growth. And in auto, originations were up 12 billion, up 71% year on year, as competitors pulled back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of 8.3 billion were up 8% year on year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing, as well as marketing.




 In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were 1.5 billion, reflecting a reserve build of 203 million, driven by loan growth in card services. Net charge-offs were 1.3 billion, up 640 million year on year, predominantly driven by card as 30-day-plus delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of 4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment banking revenue of 1.5 billion was up 11% year on year, or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year on year, and we ranked at No. 1 with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity, with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets, and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to markets. Total revenue was 7 billion, down 10% year on year. Fixed income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the securitized products group and credit.




 Equity markets was down 20% against a very strong prior-year quarter, particularly in derivatives. Payments revenue was 2.5 billion, up 61% year on year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities services revenue of 1.2 billion was up 6% year on year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of 6.9 billion were up 1% year on year, driven by higher noncompensation expense, as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the commercial bank on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of 3.8 billion was up 42% year on year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of 2.2 billion was up 79% year on year, driven by higher rates. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of 767 million was down 3% year on year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of 1.3 billion were up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter on quarter, driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing. CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior-year originations for construction loans and real estate banking, as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were 489 million.




 Net charge-offs were 100 million, including 82 million in the office real estate portfolio. And then net reserve build of 389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market, as well as net downgrade activity in middle market banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and wealth management reported a net income of 1.1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of 4.6 billion was up 8% year on year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of 3.2 billion were up 8% year on year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation, and the impact of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China, both of which closed within the last year. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were 61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by fixed income and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of 60 billion. AUM of 3.2 trillion was up 16% year on year. And overall client assets of 4.6 trillion were up 20% year on year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter on quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, and deposits were down 6%. Turning to corporate on Page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in corporate. Excluding those items, corporate reported net income of 339 million. Revenue was 985 million, up 905 million compared to last year.




 NII was 1.8 billion, up 1.4 billion year on year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of 782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of 590 million were up 384 million year on year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of 243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of [Technical difficulty] Next, the outlook on Page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex markets to be approximately 87 billion. The increase is driven by higher rates, coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain, and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out. Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately 84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So, to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. 




 Questions & Answers: OperatorPlease stand by. The first question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Oh, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed funds futures are up.




 So, it makes some sense. But maybe I guess, first, could you kind of discuss -- I guess, comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix? And what you're seeing there so far seems to be coming in a little better expected. And then secondly and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher for longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? You know, I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys have talked about.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah. So, when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's, you know, higher rates, coupled with lower deposit reprice. Hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at consumer, the combination of the passage of time, you know, and the positive feedback we're getting from the field on the CD offerings, in particular, has meant that -- you know, it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in wholesale, we're just seeing slower internal migrations.




 You know, you asked about mix. I think that, obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase, and we would continue to expect -- we would continue to -- we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic. And, you know, we could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. You know, we're not going to predict the exact moment. That's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 OK. But I guess just one follow-up on that, just if we don't get rate huts -- rate hike -- rate cuts, sorry, till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook, in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number. So, I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 OK. Great. Thanks.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you on Investor Day, do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat? And I guess you do. So, I guess I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So, you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that your more normalized NII generation is not 87 billion. You know, that being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III end game, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario, and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So, any input on that would be great.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously.




 I guess I would start by saying that, you know, when we've talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment where we're at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment. And at some level, that remains true today. Furthermore, you know, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III end game, you know, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that. Some of them could be good. Some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the Capital One, the one thing to point out is that the straight up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which, of course, goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So, we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power, we will adjust to the higher capital. So, a lot of moving parts in there. But I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios, we feel good about our ability to deliver good results, and we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out, especially after we see the Basel III proposal and it goes through the comment period.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Hey, Erika. I'd just add one thing. Due to we have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to a 100, we have some which are very capital-intensive, so we look at kind of all of them. And I think 17 is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're always earning on is credit. You know, we've been over-earning credit for a substantial amount of time now. We're quite constant about it. We know that it's going to tick up. Just as it's normalized, it'd be consuming more than that now. Like, you know, we would consider credit card normalized to be close to 3.5%. Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 And so, my follow-up question there, maybe Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It's still 5.8.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 Thank you.OperatorWe'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital. In the wake of the Barr speech, we don't have the details yet, but just kind of want to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation, both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, John. So, obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal sometime this month or something. So, soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper, and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair's Barr -- Vice Chair Barr's 2% of RWA, which winds up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception, obviously, of the fact that you can simply increase price assuming you have pricing power.




 But that's obviously not what we want, and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So, there are details. There's a lot of the FRTB stuff. You know, we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business, and we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing. But this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to, you know, the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase-in and you generating capital at a high level, even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple of years?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to select investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So, when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously, given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being, it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And, you know, if, for whatever reason, things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 OK. And there's some room for buybacks?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Unlikely [Inaudible] That would be an unlikely outcome.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 OK. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sorry, John, go ahead. Did you have a follow-up?John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 Yeah, no, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple of years strategically, just episodically buybacks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer I mean, you know, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, you know, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And, you know, we talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously, a lot of new moving parts there. Although, all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But yeah.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Got it. OK. Thank you.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the investment banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like reopening of markets and the trade-off between, you know, getting some more of those fees in and versus what's happening on the loan demand side? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Good question, Ken. So, I think in terms of investment banking and markets, yeah, some -- you know, it's better than expected. Last month, a lot of talk about green shoots, especially in capital markets generally.




 Still definitely some headwinds in M&A. You know, lower announced activity, some regulatory headwinds there. So, we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth. But away from that, for a variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, you know, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there. So, we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from card. But of course, you know, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. You know we lend through the cycle. So, I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative, which will be a function of the economy rather than a -- any tightening on our side.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the consumer side, you mentioned that consumers continue to spend, albeit a little more slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer and is that card growth continued to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to, you know, wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of what the trade-off on that side, too?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, to us, I think we still see this as a normalization, not a deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually. So, I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing, at least for our portfolio at this point. And yeah, you know, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. OK. Thank you.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the Treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Gerard, I would say, honestly, not much change there actually. You know, we've been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios.




 But at the margin, we've been biased toward higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the consequence of positive convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, you know, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So, not really a lot of change in our positioning. And that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic, which, you know, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. And we did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal. And so, as a result, we took actions to ensure that net-net, we are still about the same as we were last quarter.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the commercial banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the middle market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area of both commercial real estate, but also the C&I loans, what's happening in that segment as well?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office, for example, you know, our portfolio, as you know, is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multifamily lending. And so, as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But, you know, we'd like to be sort of ahead of the cycle. And based on everything that we saw this quarter, it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. Across the rest of the middle market segment, we saw downgrades and excessive upgrades. But I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader rate across.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Steve, are you there?OperatorIt looks like his line dropped. So, next, we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. You may proceed.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like we've all been worried about a recession for a year, and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about -- Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago. How worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle six to 12 months from now or are you leaning toward concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here, but in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent trends. And I think, generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So, obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft lending right now. You know, no lending, you know, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And, you know, whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comments that, you know, loss rates still have time to -- have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So, even forgetting about whether you got some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in the central case, you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah. And I would just add, the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use, which are hypothetical for CECL. So, asset prediction is going to all look something different, and we don't know the outcome. We're trying to be really clear here. The consumer is in good shape. They're spending down their excess cash. That's all tailwinds. If even we're going to recession, they're going in with rather good condition with low borrowings and, you know, good house price value still. But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. This war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT, which we've never experienced before. And I just think people should take a deep breath in that. And though -- we don't know if those things could put us in a soft lending, a mild recession, or a hard recession. And obviously, we should all hope for the best.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. And just to follow up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy. Like others have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the capital markets business because of FRTB? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So, on your first point, I mean, you know, I think you can just read Vice Chair Barr's speech, right? He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree, as is his right. So, we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy. So, we'll see what happens on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably like too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, you know, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And, you know, if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one example of the way sometimes when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix. There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage, where, you know, the layering on of the operational risk in the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you know, you're once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So, we'll see what happens.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I would just add to that. So, the product -- even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by product, by client, and by, effectively, business mix. And those are the adjustments. Roughly, loans don't make sense to put into your balance sheet as a whole. Almost any loan. And, you know, that's just people have to recognize that. And, you know -- so we just have to manage through all the various complications here and figure what we're supposed to do.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Thank you.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do? It's Kind of ironic or maybe it's not ironic that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high the same week as the speech. So, does that -- how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Mike --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Before -- wait, before Jeremy answer your question, I just want to say this is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone, you know, and they're dancing in the streets.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything. So, meaning, repricing, yes, definitely, to the extent that we have pricing power. And the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice, and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then, in some cases, we will have to remix, and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go into, you know, elsewhere. And that's fine.




 As Jamie points out, those people are clients. And I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. So -- but, you know, traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences. So, these are all important things to consider.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. And a separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day. It gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investment may or may not pan out. We are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by 10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should. I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues, and you're not spending $1 more on expenses.




 Like why not?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough. Is that right?Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Well, I -- wait, just to just be clear, I'm just -- it's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years, you know, going back [Inaudible]Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. Now, in all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending, based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So, broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down, too. And we've been through those moments, as you well remember. So, whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items flow, carry expense loading, and which of them don't.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And then last quick follow-up. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible] I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So, we actually sat down directly with credit compliance, audit markets, bankers, recruiter, trainers to sustain this. Mike, this is it. You know, we're full effort right now, and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful.




 So, it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things can you change all at once and add to all at once.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time. I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're getting closer?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can't extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly, on venturing -- benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time, which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be, you know, variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes, that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing in modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we talked about a lot. So, I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thank you.Operator




Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst All right. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. I wanted to ask on the deposit outlook, just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of our RRP versus industry deposits. Just want to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Good question, Steve. So, let me say a couple of things about this. So, obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks, as well as, obviously, the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of QT playing to the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple of examples, like in consumer, you know, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning, and so there are shareholder committees there. And then wholesale, we obviously invested a lot in products and services. And so, we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates. And so, there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, we -- our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that, you know, as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've seen a lot of build issuance, you know, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far, with most of the TGA build, I guess they're targeting 600, and they're up 550 or something, so they're almost done. You know, more of it than some people feared has come out of RRP. So, as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better when you've got, you know, ample supply of short-dated collateral in the front of the yield curve. So, that whole RRP TGA thing, you know, reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Helpful color. And just a follow-up on card income. You know, revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure, maybe more specifically, how much of the drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, actually, that card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So, we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of a technical thing. So, that's just a temporary headwind.




 And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior period. So -- and obviously, I know you guys look at it, but card income isn't sort of a thing that we look at that much ourselves.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Can you size the reward liability impact?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Why don't you get Michael to give that to you? It's not that significant, but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my questions.Operator




Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thank you. Just want to follow up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to competitive landscape. But I guess my question is, if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side. And I would think that there would be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material -- what are the real world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right. It really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks. And so, it's very granular. It's very product-specific. And, you know, in some of the cases, we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III end game is just that, you know, like we think the capital increases are excessive. It puts pressure on returns, all else equal. That obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy. And how all of that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly, since we don't actually have the proposal yet. So, we need those details.




 I'm sorry, Glenn, I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Actually, I think you hit on it, so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So, the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downsides -- or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside, but I just think, you know, societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that, you know, when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter, you know, and things get bad, you know, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole. So, I mean, Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, you know, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending -- I mean, the profitability swings obviously. It's reasonably cyclical. And in the recent past, it's actually been very profitable, then it was less so. Like the corresponding channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin business. It's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder. So, that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might, in fact, mean that we do less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Appreciate that, Jeremy.OperatorNext we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. You know, it's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect. And it has been an uneven usefulness in terms of the potential to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But, you know, as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we include it in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that, and that just has the effect that I talked about.




 It increases the EAR number by about 4 billion from minus 1.5, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would have been this quarter without the change, to something more like 2.5.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst But then --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never -- the answer is going to always -- for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be, for one reason or another, different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark to market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer term, you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So, as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four or five quarters, I should expect that that 2.5 should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here. I'm just trying to put those two things together.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. It's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So, I think, in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-cycle betas and all the deposits. And so, your notion that like the number would include a deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would have been using essentially terminal deposit betas for the scenario -- based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous. And so, you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta, you know, for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Right. But the -- but you were saying earlier, deposit betas, you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here and that's part of the outlook for NII longer term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. But let me add precisely --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Go ahead, Jamie.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah. OK. Basically, yes, as you have -- if the next round is going to be -- the beta go from 30 to 40 to 50. I mean, whatever the product is, yeah, that's the lag, and the 2.5 will go down over time as that actually happens if rates actually go up. If the rates don't actually go up, the 2.5 may be exactly 2.5 again.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the 87 coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration, as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And furthermore, then obviously, the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate wholesale to consumer.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yup.OperatorNext, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. So, I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess, what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So, the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share. Loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth and I think others is fairly sluggish, at least outside of card. So, I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically. But there really is a kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So, what would make you change that?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah, In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. You know, we project --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think every bank is in a different position about what they need. And so, you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city. So, you have different competition in Arizona and Phoenix than you have in Chicago, Illinois, and we do have high-interest rate products. So, it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it a big bank versus small banks. And you're going to see when everyone reports who kind of paid a little bit more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, I -- look, I would take it as a given.




 I think it's a mistake. There is very little pricing power in most of our business, and betas are going to go up. You take it as a given. There's no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through migration or direct rates or move into CDs or money market funds, and we're going to have to compete for that. You already see it in parts of our business and not in other parts.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. And I'll add there --




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Well, I 100% --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Matt, is just that it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. You know, that's the core of the strategy.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loan-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low. So, you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time to make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I assume that's the trade-off that eventually you'll --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That's a little more complicated because that -- you know, a lot of that loan-to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratios, etc.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. OK. All right. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks.




OperatorAnd for our final question, we'll go to Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Good morning. Jeremy, on Page 4 of your presentation, you showed some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration -- or I shouldn't say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity obviously for First Republic primarily. So, my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity? Because as I look out toward '24, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event to have excess liquidity.




 So, that's my first question, is what's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Charles. So, I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So, as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic. And the rest of it is just the expected, you know, decrease in systemwide deposits falling through into our HQLA balances in the bank LCR ratio. So, that's all entirely as expected. And therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story. But, you know, that's sort of the business of banking.




 We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and quarter's balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I would just add that just look at the number at the top of the page in the press release, 1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get down to no excess, we're going to have like, I've got the exact number, 1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratios are slightly -- have slightly some differences. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system. And of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Right. So, sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your 87 billion forecast for NII this year, and, you know, that implies at least a one quarter of maybe 22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-70, you know, billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of 18 billion of NII. So, that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about, you know, a 30-basis-point drop in your margin, your NIM, to get to that from 22 billion to 18 billion. I mean, what is driving -- is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the big impact is.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think of that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this, I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, but we put a little chart on a page. Just in very simple terms, this shows like what the dollar consequences are of whatever, like a 10-basis-point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So, whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower yielding to higher yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin, or whether it's because, you know, savings reprice is relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got, you know, a couple of trillion dollars of deposits. So, it's really not any more complicated than that, and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Thank you.




OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you very much.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q4 2022 Earnings CallJan 13, 2023, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57, and revenue of 35.6 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had two significant items in corporate: a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by 874 million of net investment securities loss. Touching on a few highlights. Combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year on year, with growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending.We ended the year ranked No. 1 for global IB fees, with wallet share of 8%. And credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results.




 Revenue of 35.6 billion was up 5.2 billion, or 17%, year on year. NII ex markets was up 8.4 billion, or 72%, driven by higher rates. NII ex markets was down 3.5 billion, or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees, as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower auto lease income and home lending production revenue. And market revenue was up 382 million, or 7%, year on year. Expenses of 19 billion were up 1.1 billion, or 6%, year on year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of 2.3 billion included net charge-offs of 887 million. The net reserve build of 1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm's macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case, as well as loan growth in card services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of 37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09, and record revenue of 132.3 billion. And we delivered an ROTCE of 18%. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 4. End of the quarter, the CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares, less distributions, AOCI gains, and lower RWA. RWA declined approximately 20 billion quarter on quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the markets business, which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in card services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So, given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter. Now, let's go to our businesses starting on Page 5.




 Starting with a quick update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses. Based on our data, they are generally on solid footing although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data. Combined debtor and credit -- debit and credit spend is up 9% year on year. Both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend are up year on year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year. E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize, with lower income segments and small businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower-income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year. Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of 4.5 billion on revenue of 15.8 billion, which was up 29% year on year. You'll notice in our presentation that we renamed consumer and business banking to banking and wealth management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year on year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter on quarter as spend remained strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships. Client investment assets were down 10% year on year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customer. Home lending revenue was down 46% year on year, largely driven by lower production revenue.




 Moving to car services and auto. Revenue was up 12% year on year, predominantly driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20%, and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And in auto, originations were 7.5 billion, down 12%. Expenses of 8 billion were up 3% year on year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by auto lease depreciation from lower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, product costs were 1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of 800 million in card and 200 million home lending. And net charge-offs of 845 million, up 330 million year on year. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of 3.3 billion on revenue of 10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment banking revenue of 1.4 billion was down 57% year on year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions, resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook.




 Also, note that it will be a difficult compare against last year's first quarter. Moving to markets. Revenue was 5.7 billion, up 7% year on year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed income was up 12% as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in rates and currencies in emerging markets, while securitized products continued to be challenged by the market environment. Equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year. Payments revenue was 2.1 billion, up 15% year on year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56%. And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Security services revenue of 1.2 billion was up 9% year on year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels. Expenses of 6.4 billion were up 10% year on year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full-year basis, expenses of 27.1 billion were up 7% year on year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the commercial banking on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of 1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year on year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross investment banking revenue of 700 million was down 52% year on year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of 1.3 billion were up 18% year on year.




 Deposits were down 14% year on year, up 1% quarter on quarter, primarily reflecting attrition on nonoperating deposits. Loans were up 14% year on year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter on quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter on quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and wealth management reported net income of 1.1 billion, with pre-tax margin of 33%. Revenue, 4.6 billion, was up 3% year on year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management, performance and placement fees linked to this year's market declines. Expenses of 3 billion were up 1% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisory teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were 10 billion, positive across equities and fixed income, and 47 billion for the full year. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of 33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of 55 billion for the year. AUM of 2.8 trillion and overall client assets of 4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year on year, respectively, driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter on quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by the rising rate environment, resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of 581 million. Revenue of 1.2 billion was up 1.7 billion year on year. NII was 1.3 billion, up 2 billion year on year due to the impact of higher rates.




 NIR was a loss of 115 million and reflects the two significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of 339 million were up 88 million year on year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 10. I take a sip of water. OK. We expect total NII to be approximately 73 billion and NII ex markets to be approximately 74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NIIs throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, a combination of the annualization of the hike in late December. The hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the year should be a net tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumer. In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall card spend growth, as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances, even modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale. But it's very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed funds could deviate from forwards, balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different, and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and may be quite different from what this outlook assumes. And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year. That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers, as well as deepen relationships with existing ones, and as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal.




 And just to finish up on NII, as the guidance indicates, we expect markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates. But remember, this is offset in markets NIR. Now, turning to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about 81 billion, which includes approximately 500 million from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers. We expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022 headcount growth, as well as our plans for a more modest headcount increase for the year, all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments. And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it's a more modest increase than last yea. But themes remain consistent, and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May. Of course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume and revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market dependent as always. Moving to credit on Page 12. On the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across wholesale, card, and the rest of consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook for card net charge-offs, specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this on a recent conference, and our outlook hasn't really changed. But to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future charge-offs, and it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of the year with the associated charge-offs falling about six months later.




 As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. While we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the historically low rate of 147 basis points of 2022 but still well below fully normalized levels. Well, let's turn to Page 13 for a brief wrap-up before going to Q&A. We're very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I've emphasized the uncertainty and many of the key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So, as we look forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near term, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-the-cycle target of 17% ROTCE. And with that, operator, let's open up the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: OperatorPlease stand by. [Audio gap] coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook, Slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide. As you mentioned, it looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the 74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? Maybe you could give some color about kind of the drivers of the 74 and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer




 Sure, John. I mean, I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give us stylized indication and of the fact that, you know, relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as you well know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII and also that there's, you know, as we've already talked about, a meaningful [Audio gap] The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says, you know, and the drivers within that are the usual drivers. In wholesale, we would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition, you know, especially of the nonoperating-type balances. And you're going to see some internal migration there out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing over time. In consumer, you know, CDs are flowing right now and we're seeing good CD production. We've got a 4% sitting in the market as of this morning. And so, continue to see new production. And internal migration there will be a driver. And, you know, the rest of it is -- well -- and of course, you know, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect, across the company, modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT and the rate cycle and so on. So, you know, we've got best guesses for all of those in the outlook. And of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another. And we'll just, you know, run the business this year.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK, thanks. On buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have? And any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure. So, sort of in the mode of, like, helping you guys out to put a number on the model, if you sort of look at the way we're seeing things, obviously, we've got another [Inaudible] stuff coming next year. So, say, 13.5 percent of target. And the -- sort of using your estimates, organic capital generation minus dividends, etc., and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion of buybacks for, you know, this year, for 2023.




 But you know, of course, the buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So, if we have better uses for the money, those will come first. And the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion, and also noting that we are potentially going to see a Title III NPR sometime in the first quarter or maybe in the second quarter. And while that will be an NPR and only cover part of the surface area and it won't be final, so it's unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short-term decision-making. There will be some information content about that release that could shape our decisions as well.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.




OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Hi, Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning. You know, I appreciate that there is a significant amount of, you know, uncertainty in this year's NII forecast in particular. But, you know, to follow up with, you know, John's question, I'm wondering if you could give us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you're expecting for deposit attrition and deposit data -- in terms of the terminal deposit data.




 I think, you know, the feedback I'm getting very early from investors is that, you know, they appreciate the headwinds that's occurring for NII this year. At the same time, you know, you have been consistently beating what seemed like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant 20.3 billion number in the fourth quarter. So, you know, that's why I think the more specific guardrails could be, you know, very helpful as investors try to figure out what their own expectations are versus that.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Erika. So, look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that, too, if I were you. I do think that, you know, we're trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full-year number, which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year. I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are, you know, very unlikely. And that's just a level of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because, in the end, as I said, you know, a lot of the repricing decisions that will be faced with us as a company are, you know, respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy which is about, you know, growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing, you know, every dollar of balances at any cost. So, in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for the process, as I said. Jamie, you want to supplement?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider 74 conservative. So, the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. 1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And, you know, so investors can invest in T-bills, money market funds. And of course, banks are competing for the capital money now. And banks are all in different plays, or some banks started competing heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less. But if you look at prior -- and forget what happened in 2016. I think you make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had Q -- this zero rates. We've never had rates go up this fast.




 So, I expect there will be more migration to CD, more migration to money market funds. You know, a lot of people out there competing for it. And we're going to have this change savings rates. Now, we can do it our own pace and look what other people are doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen. And I just want to point out that even at 74, we're already quite good returns. And that's not -- you know, we've always pointed out to you or sometimes we're over-earning and sometimes under-earning. I would say, OK, this time we're over-earning on NII this quarter. We're, you know, maybe over-earning on credit or maybe under-earning on something else. So, these are still very good numbers, and, you know, we're going to wait and see and we'll report to you. But I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst




 And my follow-up is, is exactly in that line of questioning. You know, let's zoom out for a second here. To your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You know, you mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession. And I'm going to reask the question I asked in the third quarter. You know, as you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind NII and headwind in the provision?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Yes, we can. You know, but a lot of factors determine that, but yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession, which I think, even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company, which is good.




 So, we're going to give you some detail around that. And those are still good returns and we can still grow. And, you know, 17 -- and remember, 17 is very good. If you compound, you know, some growth of 17%, those are extraordinary numbers. And, you know -- and I also want to point out, we don't know exactly capital needs to be at this point. And so, we have to modify that at one point.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer And, Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So, as you know and as we discussed a lot went through the pandemic in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, well, it's anchored around our economists' central case forecast, which, as you correctly say, is a mild recession. Through the way we weighed the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that's better than the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective.




 So, we just want to be clear about that.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you.Operator




The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning. I guess maybe, Jeremy, just following up on the credit assumptions underlying. If you could, give us a sense of what's assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year, be it in terms of the unemployment rate, and your outlook around just a lot of chatter around commercial real estate, the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop. Are you concerned about that? Are you seeing pain points in CRE customers given what's happening with cap rates? And then just the overall backdrop today.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer




 Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multifamily commercial term lending business is really quite different from the classic office-type business. Our office portfolio is very small Class A, you know, best developers, best location. So, the vast majority of the loan balances in commercial real estate are that sort of affordable multifamily housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So, we feel quite comfortable with it with the loss profile of that business. And so, yeah, so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So, yeah, as I said, like, the central case economic forecast has a mild recession and, if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect a slightly more conservative outlook have us, you know, imply a peak unemployment that's notably higher than that. So, you know, I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the trajectory that we've talked about in the presentation, they definitely can capture something more than a very mild soft landing. But of course, it wouldn't be appropriate to reflect a full-blown, hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Noted. And I guess just as a follow-up on, you've managed RWA growth pretty well when you look at, like, loan growth year over year, which is RWA still relatively flat. As we think about just managing capital, how should we think about the evolution of RWA? Are there still opportunities to optimize that going into whatever the Fed comes out with on Basel? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We're continuing to work very hard, and it's a big area of focus. Some of that is reflected in this course numbers, but on the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items, particularly in market risk RWA. And, yeah -- but we should be clear that although we've said that the effects of capital optimization are not, you know, a material economic headwinds for the company, they're also not zero. There are real consequences to the choices that we're making as a result of this capital environment. And then in a Basel III outcome that is, you know, unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective. There will be additional consequences.




 So, we obviously are hoping that's not the case and, you know, believe that's not appropriate, but we'll see what happens.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Noted. Thank you.Operator




The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr, Evercore ISI. You may proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. So, I'm curious. Let me talk leveraged loans for a second. You've done a good job avoiding some of these -- put on these loans sort of like the better half of the last half year. So, good call on your part. Things have gotten a lot cheaper. However, bank balance sheets, not yours, are still kind of monkeyed up with a lot of the back book.




 I'm curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough. Do you consider yourself back in? And how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up, to have available funding from the big banks?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, a couple of things there, Glenn. So, short answer is we're absolutely open for business there. Terms are better, pricing is better. We have the resources needed or fully, fully there. No overhang, no issue. Also, I think there's a bit of a narrative that, like, activity in the market needs to overcome overhang. We're not convinced that that's true. We think that the overhang is in the numbers, and people need to look forward, and the system has the capacity to handle the risks.




 So, you know, I, I recognize your point. I think it's an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the perspective of banks' ability to finance activity.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hmm. Interesting. So, maybe a bit asking, more so. OK, Maybe, Jamie, while we have you, in the last annual letter, you talked about low competitive moats and intense competition from [Inaudible] not just fintech. And I was just trying to think out aloud, is that better or worse that competitive landscape in a much higher rate backdrop? Maybe I'll just leave it at that to see where you go with it.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You know, I think it's the same, you know, because you have the apples who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmart starting theirs and, you know, obviously higher rates over some other folks in the fintech world and maybe even help some folks. So, we expect tough competition going forward in.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. Thanks.




OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Jeremy, you mentioned in your payments business that if you took out the equity investment writedowns, the growth was, you know, over 50%. Can you share with us on the equity write downs -- obviously, private equity is going through some challenging times. And I'm assuming --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There was a gain last year. It wasn't a writedown this year.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Oh, I got it. OK. I thought there was a writedown there. OK.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let me make that clear. I'm sorry about that.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Can you -- just sticking just with private equity for a moment, can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity markets to JPMorgan? Is there -- when you think about it from your loan book, or is it really just in equity investments? And maybe expand upon that.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer So, you want me to [Inaudible] There's couple of things. So, Jamie's right. The headwind, you know, year on year is primarily a function of the fact that this is an investment that, you know, just because of the measurement of alternative accounting standard, we were forced to mark up previously. Um, this is, you know, uh, an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives. So, anyway, it's fine. The point is there is a small writedown this quarter. And the important point there is that the core business is performing exceptionally well, both because of higher rates but also because of the strategy. The talk is talk a lot on Investor Day, paying off across fees and value-added services and so on and so forth. And I guess your question is, like, private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space, did I hear that correctly?




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's correct, Jeremy. And just in terms of any lending, you know, obviously, so many of these companies have seen their valuations come down considerably. Is there any elevated risk in lending to some of these companies considering the struggles they're having?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I mean, I think that's a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company. Our exposures to the sort of nonbank financial sector broadly defined. And, you know, of course, as you know, we thought a little bit about what normalized wholesale charge-offs could look like through the cycle. They're obviously higher than effectively zero, which is what we have now.




 But, you know, we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the books.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter. Two questions to that. First, the Shared National Credit exam results are always released in February. Does the reserve buildup, take some of that into account? And second, how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case, you know, the quantitative part of the decision-making for building up the reserve.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I mean, I'll give you that answer, but I'm oversimplifying a lot. I would say that --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We're oversimplifying.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Yeah, I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change, for all intents and purposes, quarter on quarter. I think that's the best way to think about the reserve.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Oh, and then, the Shared National --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible]Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah, go ahead.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The National Shared Credit thing will not affect our results materially.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. Thank you, Jamie.




OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the RWAs in advance of all the points we've made already about the pending capital regime.




 How do we -- can you help us understand what type of effect that has, if any, on parts of the income statement, whether it's NII or the trading business?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, if I just take that one. Just assume we're going to have modest growth in RWA. And in every single businesses, mortgages, loans, derivatives, how we hedge CVA and stuff like that, we take actions to manage RWA. Do not -- it does not really affect the business that much. You know, might one day, but it doesn't affect it today. And so, we don't build in -- you know, somehow, it was a little bit of this, a little bit of that. And, you know -- and the biggest opportunity down the road would be a reopening of the securitization markets. And they're still very tight.




 And I think one day they will reopen.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. And then on the -- one follow-up, just coming back to the reserving process, can you just help us understand, relative to the 5% peak in 3Q that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average and the 3.9 average baseline, just where does this fourth quarter reserve get you to? And just does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarters still stand in terms of, you know, scenario analysis on potential builds ahead of this mild recession?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 You know, can I just make it real simple? The base case is where it hits almost 5% unemployment. Then you probability wait other scenarios. That's why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn't change the probabilities in their weighting, but of course, it got worse as the base case got worse. That's all it is. We're still -- would -- still is a good benchmark. You know, keep in mind is, if we got to a relative adverse case, call that a 6% unemployment -- and then once you get there, you assume the average weighting you have wins. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more. When the base case itself deteriorates, we're moving closer to the relative adverse. That's all it is. These are all probabilities and possibilities and hypothetical numbers. You know, if I were you, I'll just look at charge-offs, like, actual results. And so -- and, you know, we break this out, but it's -- you know, it's hard to describe and everything goes slightly differently. Every bank has a slightly different base case and slightly different weighting of adverse cases, etc. And so we're just trying to make it simple as possible.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yeah, I hear you. The challenge this time is that we're going to have the income statement affect way ahead of that charge-off. So, we're all trying to adjust fit for that, but I appreciate that. Thanks, Jamie.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And once the [Inaudible] base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, would be adding the $6 billion reserves before you have charge-offs.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Exactly. Right.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Again, and maybe just out of interest, implied in your question might be a little bit to what extent does this quarter's build sort of is a down payment on the 6 billion. And the answer to that question is much less than all of it because a lot of it was earned by long growth. And some of it, as Jamie says, is driven by the flow-through of the downward revision in the central case. You could say, subject to the caveat that this is a little bit hard, not science, that there's some down payment on the six.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yep. Understood. Thank you for all that.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Betsy.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst I wanted to understand a little bit about how you're thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked already about how, you know, it's hard to predict. NII, obviously markets, you know, has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about delivering operating leverage, where the elements of the expense base are, you know, needing to be invested in, so you really can't touch, and where there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker red line, you know, you can still deliver positive operating leverage?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. So, I mean, as we -- as you know, obviously, we tend, you know, to break down our expenses across all three categories. And sometimes, the category that you're addressing is the volume and revenue-related items, which we highlight because it should pretty symmetrically respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage. So, for example, in this year's ultimate outcome, and the number that we wound up ending in 2022, the year-on-year change in volume and revenue-related expense, still finding the number of employees show you more than yesterday, but it's probably closer to $1 million.




 In other words, a year-on-year decline, whereas next year, we're assuming something more like flat. So, while the sort of year-on-year dollar change in the outlook, sort of '21 to '22 or '22 to '23 is comparable, the mix is quite different, actually. And so, for example, if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that we're budgeting or you would expect a significant drop in the volume in revenue-related numbers in the prior outlook. And that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest of it, we're always generating efficiency. And we work just as hard at that, you know, whether the revenue environment is good or bad. And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so, broadly, our investment plans really should be that sensitive to short-term changes in the environment. Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the card business, in particular, the math of what we expect, the NPV of those things [Inaudible] cycle may change in a downturn, and that could produce lower investment, all else equal. But the core strategic investments that we're making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of the environment and --Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 OK. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan's stock has been around the capital charges, the capital march, and will capital be, you know, a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years. You know, as you deliver on the positive operating leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital, obviously, and still hit those, you know, IRR and rosy targets on incremental investments. Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you're expecting to generate. And maybe that's an unfair question today, and it's a better question for Investor Day, but, you know, that's kind of the debate that's out there on the stock.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer I get it. I mean, it's a fair question. It's a good question. I'm not going to answer it super specifically.




 And Jamie may have some views or two, but let me just quickly say, we've kind of said that we feel quite confident about, you know, this company's ability to generate 17% for the cycle. And that's incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about, and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the 13 and up target in the first quarter of '24. The question of whether Basel III endgame and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is, of course, impossible to answer right now. But I would remind you that it's not just denominator expansion. You know, unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy, which goes into the numerator too. It's not what we want, but that is a possible outcome.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you.




OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. Yeah. I recognize you're evolving your business model, and you're spending money to make more money, and that your track record last decade was strong there. But, as relates to the Frank acquisition that's been in the news, I'm just wondering what that says about the financial discipline for the 15 deals that you pursued, the $7 billion of investing each year, and the one-fifth increase in expenses over three years to your guide of 81 billion in 2023.




 So, it's really a question about financial discipline. And I know you can't go into details on the Frank deal. But you earned the purchase price in two days, OK, so, I get that. And if there's fraud, there's only -- you can't do anything about fraud, but still, it diverts management resources and attention. So, maybe just, in the specifics, as it relates to the acquisition strategy, like, who sources them? Who negotiates them? Who does the due diligence? Who runs it? And ultimately, who's accountable for all these 15 different deals? And when you have investments going across business lines, which is a strength of you guys, but who's ultimately accountable when these investments don't go the way you want to? And, Jamie, you recognized a couple of years ago at Investor Day, you said, look, sometimes you're going to waste money as you're innovating and you're growing. But ultimately, who's accountable when an investment doesn't go right, like the Frank deal or another deal, or some of the other $81 billion that you expect to spend this year?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You know, obviously, Mike, it's a very good question, which we're always concerned about. We've always talked about complacency and all things like that. So, you know, obviously, when you're getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to make -- have errors. And we don't want our company to be terrified of errors so we don't do anything, and if the complacency isn't burdened by bureaucracy, which is stasis and death.




 So, you've got to be very careful when you make an error, when you cripple the firm. We are very disciplined, and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see it in our leverage lending book, you see the success of our investment, you see it in the quality of our products and services. You see it in our -- in all these things. It is no different for an acquisition. There are -- so the acquisitions are done by the businesses, but there's also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So, the business does it. The centralized team does it. We've been doing it for 20 years, like, we just started doing something like that. And obviously, there are always lessons learned. And, you know, one point I would tell you, the lesson learned here when this thing is out of litigation, but we're quite comfortable. And the people who are responsible, the people in the business, so they know that business did the acquisition, they are responsible, they were back. And we expect people, when they talk to all of us, is the good, the bad, the ugly. Whenever looking for, you know, how great everything was and obviously just been in one way or another, it was a huge mistake.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Let me -- a follow-up on that. So, that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth such as in the payments business, which I know is a focus, that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So, as you invest more in payments, which is, you know, can be a 20 or 30 PE business, which could be, you know, great if you got there, who's responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? You know, sometimes, you know, where you aggregate the data, you know, it's consumer, it's the investment bank. It could be asset management, could be commercial, could be everything, in the payments. Who's responsible for those?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 So, just to be clarified, so I would say that Marianne and Jenn, when it comes to credit, debit, checks, and all the consumer-related stuff and talk is, which, I think, was you saw the presentation about payments at Investor Day, reporting to Daniel. And that is on the wholesale payments, merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff. And they -- and those are direct responsibilities. It's quite clear, this is an area that cuts across the company. So, the payments working group that just spent time on that. That working group is not done in acquisition, and they don't -- and if they make -- they want to invest, which there are cases, by the way, would you -- and you'll see more this year, decided jointly, and all the way up to Daniel and me.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And then, last follow-up to my first start, the general comment, I mean, this is the third year in a row of about $5 billion of expense growth. And you have Slide 11 there. But that's a lot of certain front-loaded expenses for less certain back-ended benefits. How's your comfort level that you're going to see those back-ended benefits relative to the past?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Totally. And we should -- we try to show you guys in Investor Day, every branch we open for, every banker we hire, every tech thing we do, we're pretty comfortable. There are certain things like infrastructure, like, you know, getting to the cloud or stuff like that, which, you know, you can't identify all of that. But we're pretty comfortable that we -- if they weren't working, we change them. So, we ask ourselves that question every day. I mean, what managers or branches or certain things. And marketing, you always have to -- not quite have -- but have that number that is very specific. For the most part, a very specific dollar in, how many dollars out, not a guess, and we're pretty accurate in that kind of stuff. And again, if there's $1 billion that we were spending, it didn't give us the return, we cut the billion.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thank you.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. So, wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for trading in the investment banking businesses. Jeremy, given the strong pipelines you cited, I was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what you're hearing from corporate clients, especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined, when you would expect to see some inflection in investment banking activity. And similar question on the trading side. You're facing difficult comps in the coming year. We still have QT, rate volatility proxies still elevated. Do you anticipate a significant moderation in trading activity or not?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer




 Sure. Thanks, Steve. So, let's do banking first. So, I think the thing that's interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so significant, obviously, from very elevated levels. But even relative to 2019, 2022 was was a relatively weak year. And as we look ahead to 2023, it's possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in [Inaudible] That could conceivably make you pessimistic about the investment banking wallet outlook? And to be sure, it's not as if we're super optimistic. But it's important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things change in 2022, specifically with respect to rates, as that affects the debt business, and valuations as it affects M&A, and you see that as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuation and the level of the market. So, I think there's a chance that that actually winds up helping in 2023 in the investment banking world. Of course, we don't know. But, you know, those are some of the things that we're thinking about. Similarly, on the market side, obviously, markets had another very strong year, you know, better than we'd expected. Since, you know, the numbers were so strong coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw. And, you know, 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit.




 And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continued markets. As we look toward 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, it's not like the volatility is going away. And markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And, you know, 4.5%, 5% rate environment is probably one where there's more trading opportunities and there's 0% rate environment. So, you know, of course, we don't know. We'll see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. It's -- the numbers are really very strong in markets. But we'll see. We'll see what happens.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 That's really helpful color. And just my final follow-up on finalization of Basel III. Sorry, Jeremy, I couldn't help myself here, but in Barr's December speech, he strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers. You also alluded in your comments or in response to one of the questions that the finalization of Basel III can potentially be very punitive. Given the absence of the proposal, I was really just hoping you could speak to how you're scenario planning for the eventual finalization. And any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation? I think the one issue or area of confusion is that one of the biggest sources of RWA inflation is op risk, which can't really be mitigated. So, what are the actions that you can take to really offset some of those potential headwinds?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, see, I'd love to get into more detail here, but I just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. You know, and the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases, I mean, if you study this issue closely, is just to point out that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing, it's a very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, that just, like, doesn't make sense to us.




 So. we just want to say that. But yeah, Jamie, please.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let me just-- look, you guys know this operators' capital and trading bug, the CCAR or G-SIFI, all those moving parts. Let's just see what they are. We'll deal with them when we get there and, you know -- and then we'll figure out what we have to modify in business and stuff like that. We don't think it's necessary to increase capital ratios. We're quite clear on that. What are the new numbers we put in the top of the press release was our total loss-absorbing capacity. So, we have now almost 500 billion. I mean, really, like, at one point, when it's 500 billion of that, $1 trillion liquidity, all those thing's enough.




 And so -- but let's just see what it is. You know, they're going to work through whether international laws or international requirements. You know, we're hoping that America is the same as international. That would be nice. G-SIFI is supposed to be correct. Let's see if that happens. Let's just say we don't have a guess. And, you know, it's -- if the number too high, we're going to tell you what we can do about it. I don't know.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Fair enough.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible] Just minor expansion. Just to expand on that. On Jamie's point -- it's important to be clear -- there will be time to adjust. You know, like there's a long road from the NPR to, you know -- supports Jamie's point. Let's see what it is. And then we'll --




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks so much for taking my questions.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. How are you guys think of the managing the securities book given the outlook of lower deposits? Obviously, the yield curve is quite inverted depending on what part you're looking at, or most part, frankly. And at the same time, you know, the securities book is cash flowing a lot less than it was a couple of years ago, just given the rate environment.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You know, just remember that the security book is an outcome of investing that basically excess deposits. And you have like 2.4 trillion deposits and $1 trillion of loans and things like that. So -- and we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things. And so -- and then, when you say the size of it, we forecast, which I'm not going to give you the numbers -- we forecast every quarter what we're going to buy, what we're going to sell, how much is coming in, and how much we need to do liquidity.




 And we adjust it all the time based upon deposits coming down and loans and stuff like that. Obviously, what you get to invest in is, you know, a much higher rate today. And, you know, you see JPMorgan's loss in the ACM loan book as a percentage, much lower than most of the people. Remember, we're kind of conservative there too.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst So, I guess a bigger-picture question. You know, we've seen such a drop in, you know, really five, 10-year part of the curve and even further out. And, you know, banks aren't really buying. The Fed is selling. And I guess I was wondering if you have thoughts on, you know, who's buying and what's driving the rates so much lower than -- you know, most people thought they should be up.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That -- we do. But you should read -- get the House reports to get that. We look at what everybody is doing, pension plans, governments. We look at every part of the curve. We look at what other banks are doing. I think I mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different positions. Some have -- some may have to sell securities to finance their loan books. We obviously don't know. So, people are in a different position. And Jeremy pointed out, it's very important, that yield curve will not be the same six months from now that it is today. Well, we use that to kind of look forward. It's not actually our forecast, even though it will be wrong.




 And the investment portfolio will be invested when there are opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there was, you know, a 60 OAS spread. We sold -- one of the reasons we take securities losses, because that gives you $10-plus billion you can reinvest to bigger, more attractive securities.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.Operator




The final question is coming from the line of Andrew Lim from Societe Generale. You may proceed.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one on credit quality. And thanks for giving us commentary on the shape of NCOs, I guess, specifically for credit cards popping out at the end of this year. Could you give us a bit more color on how reserve builds should shape out this year? I guess, you know, with respect to CECL, I'm guessing that it should top out quite soon. That's my first question.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible] OK --Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Just assuming all your macro assumptions are unchanged and only macro assumptions are unchanged and ready to [Inaudible] and so forth.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Well, I think we've talked about CECL quite a bit. And I think there's some decent color there in terms of Jamie's, you know, 6 billion over a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We're definitely not going to get into the business of giving you an outlook for a sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance that, you know, it's appropriate today and it will evolve as a function of the environment.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Sure. OK. Let's drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments made there, Jaime.




 So, if I heard you correctly, I think you're still talking about sequential increases in NII. So, I guess looking toward like 20 billion-plus for 1Q, maybe even 2Q. So, I guess we're hitting about 40 billion for 1H, and then a sharp drop-off. As, say, deposit costs increase, maybe we get a few Fed fund rate cuts as well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, no. So, let me uncontroversially say no, there just really wouldn't. So, the -- my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which you are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that in a world where we're exiting the fourth quarter run rate at 81, and we're telling our ADX markets or whatever, and we're telling you 74 for the full year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We're simply saying don't project those into the future in perpetuity.




 Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. That answer --Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Right. But you -- yeah. No, no, sure. Absolutely. That makes sense. That's great. Thanks for that.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks.OperatorWe have no additional questions in queue. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Barnum.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Executive Officer That's it. Thank you very much. Thank you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. We'll talk to you all soon.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q3 2022 Earnings CallOct 14, 2022, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2022 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As always, the presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 18%. The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in corporate of $959 million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling U.S. treasuries and mortgages. Our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment.Touching on a few highlights. We had a record third quarter -- we had record third-quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion, we ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit is still healthy with net charge-offs remaining low. On Page 2, we have more detail. Revenue of $33.5 billion was up $3.1 billion or 10% year on year. Excluding the net investment securities losses, it was up 13%. NII ex-markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex-markets was down $3.2 billion or 24%, largely driven by lower IB fees and the securities losses.




 And markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year on year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year on year, driven by higher structural costs and investments. And credit costs of $1.5 billion included net charge-offs of $727 million. The net reserve build of $808 million included a $937 million build in wholesale, reflecting loan growth and updates to the firm's macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in home lending. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI. RWA was down approximately $23 billion quarter on quarter, with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk RWA. Given our results this quarter, we are well-positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2023. These current targets include a 50 basis point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibility over the coming quarters. To conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk-based requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint. So we announced the call of $5.4 billion in press this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub-debt to rebalance our capital stack. Now let's go to our businesses, starting on Page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, with combined debit and credit spend up 13% year on year. Cash offers remain elevated across all income segments.




 However, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits year on year, particularly in the lower-income segment. And not surprisingly, small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks and the economic outlook. Now moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which was up 14% year on year. In consumer and business banking, revenue was up 30% year on year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were up 10% year on year and down 1% quarter on quarter. We ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60% year on year, making us the fastest-growing among the top 20 banks. And we are now No. 1 in L.A., in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top-ranked in the three largest markets. Client investment assets were down 10% year on year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows, while lending revenue was down 34% year on year on lower production margins and volume. Moving to card and auto. Revenue was up 9% year on year, driven by higher card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18%. And while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And in auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 35%, due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates.




 Expenses of $8 billion were up 11% year on year driven by the investments we're making in technology, travel, marketing, and branches. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $679 million, which were up $188 million year on year, largely driven by loan growth in card as well as a reserve release of $150 million in home lending. Card delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization. Next, to CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.7 billion was down 43% year on year. IB fees were down 47% versus a strong third quarter last year. We maintained our No. 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year. Underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity. In terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year. And while our existing pipeline is healthy, conversion will, of course, depend on market conditions. Funding revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher NII on loan growth. Moving to Markets. Revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year on year.




 Fixed income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in securitized products. Equity markets were down 11% against a record third quarter last year. This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity. Payments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year on year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Securities services revenue of $1.1 billion was relatively flat year on year. Expenses of $6.6 billion were up 13% year on year, largely driven by compensation. Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486 million. Moving to commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of $946 million. Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21% year on year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross investment banking revenue of $761 million was down 43% year on year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year on year. Deposits were down 6% year on year and quarter on quarter, primarily driven by attrition of nonoperating balances, while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust. Loans were up 13% year on year and 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization.




 CRE loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial-term lending and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charge-offs remained low. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. The asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pre-tax margin of 36%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year on year, predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 10% year on year, driven by compensation, including investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology, and asset management initiatives. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year on year, respectively, driven by lower market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows. And finally, loans were flat quarter on quarter, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows. Turning to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million. Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion last year. NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year on year, driven by the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $305 million were higher by $125 million year on year. Next, the outlook on Page 9.




 Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firmwide NII. For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately $19 billion, implying full year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion. And we expect NII ex markets for the fourth quarter to also be about $19 billion, implying that we expect markets NII to be around zero, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion. While we're not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 NII ex-markets run rate of $66 billion, with potential upside for the full year 2023. Today's guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of $76 billion. And from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full year 2023. In addition, there's quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice and loan growth. So keep both of those things in mind as you update the 2023 estimates in your models. Moving to expenses. Our outlook remains unchanged. And as it relates to the card net charge-off rate, we now expect the full-year rate to be approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations. So to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks. 




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. I just wanted to give you a little more insight into how we're looking at capital and interest rates a little bit. So capital planning, we're very comfortable with the earnings power of this company, which, you can see, is enormous and the margins and the returns. And more importantly than that is we're growing franchise value, I think, all around the firm. And in most areas, we're up in market share, in a few areas, we're not, and of course, that disappoints us. But the earnings power gives us a lot of confidence that we'll get over that 13% in the first quarter. But we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things. So we know we have to deal with Basel IV. We don't know when and how this is going to be, and any change in G-SIB such as an uncertainty in back of our mind. AOCI. AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but this kind of environment is more pro-cyclical.




 So think of this ratio below 100 basis points, that's $4 billion, easily can handle it just in the back of our mind. CECL. CECL already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be. But obviously, if the environment gets worse, we'll have to add to reserves. And/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher, we'll change our reserves. Put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you're probably talking about $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters. Again, easy to handle, not a big deal. It just doesn't affect capital a little bit. And then RWA management, I mean, I think we're showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that. With that what I would say, a very limited financial effect. And the way you should look at this is we don't tell commercial bank or investment bank don't get new business, don't serve your clients. So we're serving clients that we always do, and you see the loan book growing in a lot of areas, but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us. So we're not putting -- conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate the most part. Because it makes very low sense to do that in the balance sheet, and we make other choices. And so we've got a lot of tools to manage it. Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we're going to find ways to reduce RWA.




 I'm talking about over years strategically, I think without affecting our basic franchises. Interest rates. I think the way to look at it is we're fairly neutral at this point. Interest rates going up or down. Jeremy said the $19 billion, please do not annualize that. There are a lot of uncertainties today. And I'm just going to mention a few. We're not worried about them. It's not going to change things dramatically, but does change things. What's going to be Q2's effect on deposits? How much deposit migration you're going to have in this new technological environment? And there are pluses and minus from that. And of course, there will lag. There are lags in consumer. There can be some lags in treasury services. There can be some lags and commercial banking. So it's just on the back of the mind, we're going to kind of actively manage that. And the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part, it could be want to sell our rich securities and replacement chief securities.




 We don't want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better. So you might expect to see that taking place now. There may be some securities loss in the future, we can do that. We're not doing -- we can do this to manage interest rate exposure. But for the most part, we can do that with swaps to or other things. We just do it the most efficient and effective way. I want the people that manage these portfolios to know that we can sell things we don't want to own and buy things that we do want to own. And other than that, we think it was a very, very good strong quarter across the board. And I guess, we'll open for questions now.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Let's go ahead and open up for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorAnd the first question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie's comments there. Obviously, one of the toughest uncertainties is to understand think about flows and mix and beta. So just starting to see it, it looks like in terms of deposit costs starting to increase. So how do you think about it now in this new environment, where we might go to 4.5, maybe higher in terms of how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks, Ken. So at Investor Day, you'll recall that Jamie said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing, as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop, is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle, just through the actuals. And the question is why is that? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably means that some of this is lagged, but also the fact that the system is more better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles. So as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point, that will start to come out. Obviously, in wholesale, they come out much faster.




 That's probably starting to happen now. The exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. OK. And then just the second follow-up on Jamie's points about like, OK, if things do look worse ahead, looking ahead, you might have to build a little bit more understandable over the next couple of years. Can you just help us understand just where you are in your scenario scenarios built and just today still looks great, tomorrow, there's some more uncertainty. So how do we just get to start to understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta? And how do you think about it versus either, I don't know, pandemic peak or day one CECL? It's very hard for all of us to see this, of course.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. As you know, I think CECL has informed us the bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it because it's not a real number. It's a hypothetical probability-based number. And the way I'm trying to make it very simple for you. So if you look at the pandemic, we put up $15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that, OK? And all it did swing all these numbers, and it didn't change that much. I'm trying to give you a number, obviously, this number to be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 60%, and that becomes the central kind of case, and then you have possibilities to get better and possibilities gets worse, we would probably add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters. I mean that's as simple I can make it. Right now, what we have -- right now, we already have 8% in these adverse -- in severe adverse case. We can -- if we change that next quarter, that will be part of that $6 billion I'm talking about.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yes. Understood. OK.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst I guess just following up, Jamie. So I appreciate CECL and the model-based approach. I think you were quoted in the press talking about the potential for a recession in the next six to nine months. Would appreciate any perspective in terms of are you beginning to see cracks, either be it commercial real estate, consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation, higher rates is beginning to filter through to your clients? I would appreciate any insights there.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I'll take the over him. Thanks. The short answer to that question is just no.




 We just don't see anything that you could realistically describe as a crack in any of our actual credit performance. I made some comments about this in the prepared remarks on the consumer side. But we've done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that. And we do see, in some cases, some tiny increases. But generally, in almost all cases, we think that's normalization, and it's even slower than we expect.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think I'd say we're in an environment where it's kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend. You see it in our numbers. You see it in other people's numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% pre-COVID.




 Balance sheets are very good for consumers. Credit card borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse. You might see -- and that's really good. So you go in a recession, you've got a very strong consumer. However, it's rather predictable if you look at how they're spending and inflation. So inflation is 10% reduces that by 10%. And that extra cap -- money they have in the checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime midyear next year. And then, of course, you have inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil volatility war. So those things are out there, and that is not a crack in current numbers. It's quite predictable. It will strain future numbers.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the systems, be it the U.K. gilts market, LBOs. How much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at some point over the next year, just given all the QT happening around the world?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it's a very large change in the flow of funds around the world, who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt. There's a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at the building alone is a bump, it's not going to change what we do or how we do it. And you're going to see bumps like that because all of the things I already mentioned. It's inevitable that you're going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don't know. I have pointed out, it's harder for banks to intermediate in that, and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that you're going to see a crack of some sort.




 But again, it's almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the fact where I told you. Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Jeremy, at the Investor Day, you noted that expense growth in '23 would slow from this year's level and might be slightly higher than consensus expectations at the time. So is that -- now that you get closer to next year, does that still hold? And if the economy does get worse than expected, is there some levers to pull? Or is it just still investing heavily regardless?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks, Jim. So broadly, yes, it still holds. No real change on the outlook. Just to remind everyone, at Investor Day, I think the consensus was 79.5 for 2023. We said you were a little low. I think it got revised up to sort of the 80.5 or something like that. And that's still -- that's not -- still roughly in the right ballpark.




 Obviously, we're going through our budget cycle. We're looking at the opportunity side and the environment set for next year. So it's not in stone. But broadly, on the question of investment, and I'm sure Jamie will agree here, that our investment decisions are very much through-the-cycle decisions. And so we're not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the short-term economic environment. Of course, the volume and revenue-related expense can fluctuate as a function of the environment, as you would expect.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Now I would just like to add. Obviously, compensation go up or down dramatically. So you'll have different estimates about investment pacing revenues and markets revenues, and we can't really adjust for your numbers for that. But I just want to point out the other side of this, we're making heavy investments and we have among the best margins in the business.




 I think that's a very good thing.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Right. And maybe on that front, leverage loan, right? Were there any leverage loan write-downs this quarter? And is that -- and how do you -- is that market beginning to clear? Or are there still overhangs?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 There are no real levels of loan write-down this quarter, and that market isn't yet clear. Our share of it is very small. So we're very comfortable.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 Jeremy, I wanted to ask about your EAR disclosures, what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures. They look a little different than peers. And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you're liability-sensitive. Can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the assumptions behind it?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. It's really all about lags. So as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EAR calculation. So as a result of that, the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state. As you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time. So as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this year.




 As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from 50 at the beginning of the year to now 61.5. So as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities or rate fluctuations given the lag environment that we're in.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst And just to follow up on Jamie's comments about not annualizing the fourth quarter, is that where the risks lie to annualize in the fourth quarter? What are some of the puts and takes that you said it might be down a little bit from that fourth quarter annualized?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. I've already mentioned, you have a rapidly changing yield curve deposit migration. Everyone does EAR differently. So one is lag. One is we assume deposit migration. Some people don't. We assume -- our ECR is included there, some people don't and all of that. I just think for your models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the 19. So instead of 76, use a number like 74. Just keep it as simple as possible, and we don't know. We hope to beat that, but with all the stuff going on, I just -- you just got to be a little cautious and conservative.Operator




The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful. So I'm going to ask the question that I think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year. So at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17%, and that was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June. As we think about your capital build is going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 17% ROTCE next year?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. That's obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So we're very honest. We are -- we're not over earning in NII, maybe a little bit because the lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are over earning on credit. Think of credit card. And the 1.5%, we've never seen a number of that low risk. We're quite conscious of that. So we don't drag about the 19% this quarter, figure that's going to continue [Inaudible] not. And obviously, we may adjust that 17 a little bit, but it's not a material adjustment. We're going to -- we've got a lot of great, bright people. We're going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like call CCAR is and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisition, for example, they were a non-G-SIFI acquisitions, noncapital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service related. So that's what we're going to do over time, and we're pretty comfortable that we'll get very good returns. So yes, we're quite -- and next year is totally dependent on what happens in [Inaudible].




 But the other thing I would look at, maybe both given this number of other time, is what would we earn in a recession? We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean, so I feel very good about that.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst And this is a super micro question as a follow-up for Jeremy. Why would Markets NII be zero next quarter? And should we expect that to be zero next year?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. Thanks.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We're advancing the Markets businesses at the yield curve. So you're earning this in your pain to finance the training book.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes, Erika. I mean, basically, as rates go up, the funding cost goes up. And the offsets on the other side, in many cases, work through derivatives or derivatives like instruments, so it goes through NIR. Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensitive. You can see that history through our disclosures this year. So as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn't expect to see as many changes at least from rates. Of course, we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased one way or the other.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Jamie, once again, I'm trying to reconcile your actions with your words. You've said publicly, you mentioned the hurricane. You mentioned a recession. You mentioned look out, and there are all sorts of risks. I don't think anyone disagrees with that. On the other hand, your reserves to loans are still well below CECL day one. So your actions with the reserving don't seem to reflect your more pessimistic comments about the economy. So how do I reconcile the two?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. So the way to do that is in our CECL -- in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already. So it's in there already. A lot of people work in the CECL reserves. Our economist, Jeremy, a lot of other folks. It's not set by me because I have to think that the odds might be different than other people. And so -- but I conclude as Jeremy saying. But the numbers are very good. We have some of that. I'm trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here's what it might will mean for reserves. That may be different because, of course, these calculations change a lot of time. But that will be, Michael, which is another thing, which is CECL, the timing of when something happens is very important. So if it happens, if you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter of next year, that would be very different. So it's going to happen in the first quarter of next year.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yes, I just understood it as the lifetime losses on the loans as opposed to that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It is. But some loans -- yes, some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Let's just cut to the chase. So where are you versus three months ago? I mean, is it -- you certainly got headlines with the hurricane comment and all that. And it's -- look, like as you said, you have Fed tightening, QT, tighter capital rules for banks. You have like the trifecta of tightening by the Fed and then you have bars and everything else. So I don't think any in the stock market supports your view and about all the risks out there, but are things better or worse or the same as they were three months ago?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 They're roughly the same. We're just getting closer to what you and I might consider bad events. So -- in my hurricane, I've been very consistent, but looking at probabilities and possibilities. There is still, for example, a possibility of a soft land. We can debate what we think that percentage of yours might be different than mine, but there's a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, coming in a very good shape. And there's possibility is something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that. Those -- I would not change by possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter, for me. And then lastly is a different point.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Yes. Last follow-up. I know your investor cycles. You've always done that. You're consistent. But I mean, your headcount increase is probably going to be the highest in the industry. I mean, headcount from 266,000 to 288,000, your CIB, you're adding headcount. I mean you did expect weakness in nine months from now, wouldn't you wait to hire people, maybe get them a little cheaper?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No.




OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst A couple of questions. One, just on the investment spend. Could you give us a sense as to the areas that you're leaning in the most as we should be thinking about into next year? Because you've obviously done a lot this year with regard to technology advancement, companies that you're buying to enhance your digital capabilities and international expansion, in particular on the consumer side. So just thinking through is this continuation on those themes? Or is there something else we should be looking for?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Betsy, it's exactly what we showed you at Investor Day, almost no change. So take out that deck, we broke out by business kind of investment. Investment spend in tech is pretty much on track for that.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst And the inflation that drives some of that cost structure, you can deal with through just efficiencies elsewhere. Is that fair?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Believe it or not, that was in the numbers we gave you in May.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. And then separately on the bond restructuring that you did this quarter and the comments around, look, we don't need to hold stuff we don't need to hold. We don't want to hold with that. That kind of suggests to me that there'll be more bond restructuring as we go through the next quarter.




 Is there a reason why you didn't clean the whole thing up this quarter?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap. So if you look at -- if you looked what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out. They gapped in, we bought. They gapped out, we sold. And that kind of stuff getting to. So you can have different point of views. And I do expect future bond losses going forward. I just don't think that's real earnings.




 So I think if I want our people -- our experts in the investment areas to know, if they really want to sell something, we're going to sell it. We're not going to sit here and lock ourselves into somebody who's gotten very, very rich because we feel like we can't take a bond loss. And remember, it doesn't affect capital. And in fact, when you reinvest it, which we tend to do, we actually have higher earnings going forward.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 And let me just add too, like you saw the CLOs gapped out in Europe. I want our people, when they gap out like 300 or 400 basis points, I want them to be willing to buy. They might sell something to do that, but that is a very smart thing to the pen.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. So it's Glenn. So look, from time to time, where things happen in the market, we get these losses like [Inaudible] and now this U.K. pension LDI issue. So my question for you is, besides that, do you have risk in the derivatives book? And is the situation done? It's more of when you meet with risk committee, are there pockets of leverage that you're considering on these big market moves, whether it be the dollar or rates where we are not thinking of like us? Or do you view the LDI issue as an isolated event?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'll mention, and Jeremy, you might have something to add. So the LDI thing is a bump in the road. And I think the Bank of England is also trying to get through this thing without changing the policy about monetary policy and QT. And I was surprised to see how much leverage there was in some of those pension plans. And my experience in life has been you have things like what we're going through today, there are going to be other surprises. Someone is going to be offsides. We don't see anything looks systemic, but there is leverage in certain credit portfolio, this leverage for certain companies is leverage. So you're probably going to see some of that. I do think you see volatile markets. You already see very low liquidity. So something like the LDI think could cause more issues down the road, if it happens constantly and stuff like that. But so far, it's a bump in the road.




 The banking system itself is extraordinarily strong.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Would the dollar qualify as one of those super strong moves that could put people offsides? And if so, how do you make sure you protect JPMorgan against that?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Well, we're -- because we're -- we generally -- we do not -- we're not taking them. We owe hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that. But yes, dollar flows, QT, emerging markets hedge funds, yes, that would be a category that might -- something might happen there. It wouldn't be -- it shouldn't be something that's going to affect JPMorgan that much. In fact, it usually creates an opportunity for JPMorgan.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, I'm not going to [Inaudible] is traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle, sovereign struggle with the kind of dollar strength that we're experiencing right now, but our emerging market franchise folks have been through these cycles before. So we manage through it.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just to add to the strength of the franchise, I remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade, it was shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries we ever lost money. We may have had low returns in some quarters, but it was shocking. We made money in Argentina every -- almost every year for the last 20 years. And I think there was one quarter we put up reserves for one of the oil companies and took them down, but it's kind of very -- the stability is striking.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst You guys have been talking about the system liquidity with, Jamie, you referenced QT, also the fragility of the system. Can you share with us what are the metrics you guys are looking at to see if the system does have a problem on liquidity? Just this week, you probably saw that the Swiss National Bank upped its reserve, currency swapped lines to $6.3 billion. So what are some of the things you guys focus in on to see if there's going to be maybe more -- some liquidity issues that could lead to greater problems?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I mean, Gerard, broadly, if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of LCR ratios in the U.S. banking system, everyone just has very significant surpluses. And of course, we can go into the question of as QT plays through and how that interacts with RPM loan growth, whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits, but that's starting from a very, very strong position.




 So there's a lot of cushion there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. We look at everything from the Fed repo, deposit tightening to net issuance of treasury, net issuance of mortgages and treasury volatility and treasury bid-ask spreads and treasury markets and all that. We're looking at all of that. The banking itself is extremely strong, extremely strong. It's not -- what you're going to see will not be in the banking. And there may be a bankers outside somewhere, but it will be somewhere else. It will be somewhere else. It might be in credit, it might be in emerging margins.




 It might be in FX, but you're likely to have something like that, you have events like the ones we're talking about.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. And then in terms of the investment banking and capital markets businesses, can you guys give us any color into pipelines, how they stood at the end of the third quarter? And as you're going into the fourth quarter, what you're seeing in terms of those business lines?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. And I've always pointed out to you all, the pipelines come and go, OK? You've seen that the size, there never had before. So pipeline is not necessarily to see. I would put in your model lower IB revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today. Markets, we have no idea. Seasonally, it's generally a low quarter, the fourth quarter, but we don't know this quarter because there's so much activity taking place, and your guess is as good as ours.OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Can you guys talk about the outlook for loan growth the next few quarters? And besides some of the obvious areas like leverage lending and correspondent mortgage you already talked about, any areas that you're tightening around the edges?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Matt, let me take your last question first. So in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle. We haven't -- we didn't really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great. And so we don't see any need to tighten now, really a lot of consistency there.




 In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we have said for this year, obviously, only one quarter left, that we'd have high single digits. No meaningful change in that outlook there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates, as you mentioned, and some of the RWA optimization in mortgages. As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the card story across a range of dimensions, in terms of both outstandings and revolve normalization. But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it's going to be, I think, very dependent, especially in wholesale on the macro situation. We know that in recession environments, we tend to see lower loan demand. At the same time, we've got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients. So we'll just have to see how that plays out next year.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And I guess when we read headlines about home prices going down in some markets and car prices starting to roll, I mean, why doesn't that drive some tightening in those businesses?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, it has. I mean look at the volumes and mortgage have dropped and cars on the quota have dropped and stuff like that. And that's already in our numbers, and we would expect that to continue that way.OperatorThe last question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Yes. I'm just curious in your guidance on NII where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate. Next year, do you factor in any impact from a possible treasury buyback program, which could direct liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system, and therefore, keep your deposit betas lower? Do you think about that at all as a possibility?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think -- I don't know if you were listening when I said it before, QT, net issuance in mortgages, net issuance in treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility and absolutely incorporated that our thinking, including lags, the change in the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you. And that's why we're being trying to be conservative in NII, that while you can annualize the 19 to 76, you have a model, put in 74 and it incorporates all of that.




OperatorAt the moment, there are no further questions on the line.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, thank you very much, and we'll talk to you all next quarter.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.Operator[Operator signoff]

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q2 2022 Earnings CallJul 14, 2022, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2022 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 17%. Touching on a few highlights. We had another quarter of strong performance in markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is still quite healthy, and net charge-offs remain historically low.And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses, with average loans up 7% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year on year. NII ex Markets was up $2.8 billion or 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex Markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and higher card acquisition costs, and markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year on year. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year on year, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $657 million and reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3.




 Let's start by talking about our plans for capital management over the coming quarters. The new 4% NCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter, and the 4% G-SIB effective in 1Q '23 further raises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB to be higher and made it clear that in the near term, share buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than expected, we have paused buybacks for the near term. As we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows us to rapidly build capital in excess of future requirements with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any access over the regulatory requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in line with our strategic priorities. We have a long-established track record of balance sheet discipline across the company, and this quarter's RWA reduction shows evidence of this discipline. Turning to this quarter's results, you can see that our CET1 ratio of 12.2% and is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. RWA was down approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and the normalization of market risk RWA from the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me touch on what we're seeing in our data regarding the health of the U.S. consumer. Spend is still healthy with combined debit and credit spend up 15% year on year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across income segments. Notably, the average consumer is spending 35% more year on year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories.




 At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending, including in the lower income segments, with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year-on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across income segments for the first time since the pandemic started, though cash buffers still remain elevated. With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion, which was down 1% year on year. In Consumer and business banking, revenue was up 9% year on year, driven by growth in deposits. Deposits were up 13% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter. And client investment assets were down 7% year on year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows. Home lending revenue was down 26% year on year as the rate environment drove both lower production revenue and tighter spreads, partially offset by higher net servicing revenue. And mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%. Moving to card and auto. Revenue was down 6% year on year, reflecting higher acquisition costs on strong new card account originations and lower auto lease income, largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion, down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates, while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year on year driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $611 million, down $121 million year on year, driven by card and a reserve build of $150 million in card driven by loan growth. Next to CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion.




 There were a number of notable items this quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million was about $345 million reflected in payments and markdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue. Investment banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 61% year on year or down 53%, excluding the Bridge book markdowns. IB fees were down 54% versus an all-time record quarter last year. We maintained our No. 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In advisory, fees were down 28%, reflecting a decline in announced activity, which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in muted issuance in our underwriting businesses. Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy, conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 million was up 79% versus the prior year, driven by gains on mark-to-market hedges as well as higher loan balances. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year on year in both fixed income and equities against a strong quarter last year. In fixed income, elevated volatility drove both increased client flows and robust trading results in the macro franchise, most notably in currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by credit unsecuritized products in a challenging spread environment. In equity markets, we had a strong second quarter, and again, increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $218 million, largely driven by funding spread widening.




 Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year on year or up 25%, excluding the markdowns on equity investments. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by higher rates. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year on year, with growth in fees and higher rates more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion were up 3% year on year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to commercial banking on Page 6. The commercial banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year on year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue. Gross investment banking revenue of $788 million was down 32%, driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% year on year, predominantly driven by higher structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter on quarter, driven by migration of nonoperating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, which we expect to continue given the current rate environment. Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6%, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle market and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth, while net charge-offs remain historically low. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1 billion with pre-tax margin of 31%.




 For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year on year, driven by growth in deposits and loans as well as higher margins, partially offset by investment valuation losses versus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 13% year on year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology, and asset management as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, down 8% and 6% year on year, respectively, were predominantly driven by lower market levels, partially offset by net long-term inflows. And finally, loans were up 1% quarter on quarter, while deposits were down 7% sequentially, driven by seasonal client tax payments. Turning to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII was $324 million, up $1.3 billion, predominantly due to the impact of higher rates. And expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million year on year. Next, the outlook on Page 9. You will recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex Markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now expect it to be in excess of $58 billion, reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately $77 billion and the card net charge-off rate to be less than 2% for 2022. So to wrap up, the company's performance was strong again this quarter in what was a complex operating environment.




 As we look forward, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well-positioned for a broad range of outcomes. With that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: OperatorPlease stand by. And the first question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Hey. Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. I wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. I don't believe you've provided an update on your firmwide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13%. And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your G-SIB surcharge to 4.5%, your regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on Slide 3. And just given that high regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital target for you to manage from here over the long term?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Steve. Good question. So obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, have two G-SIB bucket increases coming, one in the first quarter of '23 and the other one in the first quarter of '24.




 So we had worked all that out on Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected. So for now, we're really focused on 1Q '23. Of course, all else equal, you would assume that, that 12.5% to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher. But there is another round of SCB, and that's a long way away. And as you know, and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll kind of cross that bridge when we come to it.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we intend to drive that SCB down by reducing the things that created it.




Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Fair enough. And just for my follow-up on the loan growth outlook. Loan growth continues to surprise positively. Certainly, the tone, Jeremy, that you conveyed was quite constructive despite the challenging macro backdrop. But with companies just citing higher inventory levels, declining personal savings rates, growing inflationary pressures, whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here, I was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different businesses? And what do you see as a sustainable run rate of loan growth over the medium term?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. So we've talked, as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid -- high single digits loan growth expectation for this year. And that outlook is more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination. We're also seeing good growth in CRE. And of course, we continue to see very robust card loan growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now. And obviously, as you know, it's going to be very much a function of the economic environment, so --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. The only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio-based, think of mortgages, and there's a good chance we're going to drive it down substantially.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks so much for taking my questions.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Steve.OperatorThe next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all? Meaning JPMorgan is always growth-minded. You underwrite for returns over the cycle. I get that. But given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that you've noted in some of the articles you've been in and at the conference, is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightened the underwriting box to build capital and liquidity faster? Or do you think you can get there just through what you've laid out today on the buyback pause?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. No. So I mean, look, I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So first of all, as you can see on Page 3, the organic capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time, if not early. At the same time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we're going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elements or lending, which are either low returning or have a low client nexus or both.




 We do that all the time anyway. But of course, in this moment, we're going to turn up the heat on that a little bit. In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box. And I don't think we expect any particular change there.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So if you look at our bridge book, it's smaller than it was because we price ourselves out of the market. And that was a good thing because a lot of people can lose a lot of money there, and we lost a little. And so we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst I appreciate that. And did you all consider a CECL reserve and increasing the probability to the poor scenario in this quarter? And just curious on how you thought about that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. But we didn't do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. And, Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what's implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably, we were sort of early on that. So it really wasn't necessarily this quarter.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst All right. Thank you, both.




OperatorThe next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please proceed.John McDonald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends you're seeing, the differences between commercial deposits, wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Great question, John. And I think you're right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics there. So on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition, and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in the sense that for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the commercial bank for nonoperating deposits, knowing fully that our pricing strategy, as rates went up, was going to be to not pay up, and therefore, we expected the attrition from those -- from that client base. And so we're seeing that, and that's actually something that we want, all else equal, and it's playing out in line with expectations. You do see a little bit of a decline or a little bit of a headwind in wealth management. I think that's just seasonal tax payments being a little bit higher than usual. And then on the consumer side, we're really not seeing much at all. So that remains strong, not seeing any attrition there, and it's early in the cycle to really be observing much one way or the other from a pricing perspective.




John McDonald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. And then as a follow-up, in terms of the updated NII outlook, you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about $66 billion at Investor Day. Just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate ex you have assumed in your outlook.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So the 66 number, if you want, kind of to put a number in, you can use something like 68, 68 plus, something like that. Obviously, we're annualizing one quarter. So there can always be noise in there, but that seems like a good number to us.




 That's consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2023.John McDonald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 A good deposit [Inaudible]. Yes.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Yes. Yes. So in terms of '23, we had talked at Investor Day about how we saw upside into 2023 from that fourth quarter run rate. And that more or less remains true. There is some upside. Obviously, we're starting from a higher launch point, higher rates and less so after the CPI brand, but there have been moments where there were cuts in the 2023 Fed expectations. So that could have some impact on the dynamic.




 Obviously, this is all in an environment very volatile implied, but the core view of some upside from that fourth-quarter run rate into 2023 is still in place.John McDonald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.Operator




The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hey, Betsy.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Jamie, you mentioned just on the SCB earlier that you intended to reduce it by reducing the things that caused it to rise. Could you give us a sense as to what you saw in the results that you got that drove that SCB up, because I talked to folks to say it's a black box. So it would be helpful to understand what you see as what the drivers were to that SCB increase.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer First of all, it's public. So you can actually go see what drives it, the global market shock and credit loss and stuff like that. And we don't agree with the stress test. It's inconsistent. It's not transparent. It's too volatile. It's basically capricious arbitrary. We do 100 a week.




 This is one. And I need to drive capital up and down by 80 basis points. So we'll work on it. We haven't made definitive decisions. But I've already mentioned about we dramatically reduced RWA this quarter. We may do that again next quarter. We're probably going to drive down mortgages, and we'll probably drive that other credit too that creates SCB. So I could go into specifics on that. It's easy for us to do. You've seen us do it before. We're going to drive out non-IP deposits. it creates no risk to us, but as the G-SIFI and various things. And so we're going to manage the balance sheet, get good returns, have great clients and not worry about it. We just want to get there right away. I don't want to sit there and do [Inaudible] out. That's the rule.




 They gave it to us. We're going.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. And then –Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hey, Betsy. Maybe I'll just jump in a little bit on the black box.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There's another very important point for shareholders. That number, that doesn't need remotely -- the stress loss doesn't even remotely represent what happened under that kind of scenario. And I'm not saying the Fed says it should or shouldn't. But I would tell you, we'd make money under that scenario. We wouldn't lose -- I think they had us losing $44 billion. There's almost no chance that that would be true. And I just -- and I feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and say, ""Well, what's going to happen?"" And in by, there's good evidence. We didn't lose money after Lehmann.




 We didn't lose money in the great -- what just happened. We didn't lose money, great financial recession. The company has got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in CCB, asset management, custody, payment services. And then we have some kind of fairly volatile streams. Now we've got the CECL, which obviously can go up or down quite a bit. But again, that's an accounting entry. And so we feel in very good shape. We just have to hold a higher number now, and we're going to go there.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer And Betsy, maybe I'll just comment briefly on the black box point because as Jamie noted, the SCB is quite volatile, and I think you see that across the industry, and it's -- you have to -- we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements, but with pretty big changes that come into effect fairly quickly for banks, and I think that's probably not healthy. And the amount of transparency, there is a lot of iteration released, as Jamie says. But since the SCB is really a quantity that gets measured to the peak drawdown period, and that information does not get released, it winds up being really very hard at any given moment to understand what's actually driving it. And that combination of suboptimal transparency and high volatility is really our central criticism, I guess, I would say.




 But nonetheless, you got capital general.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer This got bad effects for the economy because, I just said, we're going to drive down this and drive down. It's not good for the United States economy. And the mortgage business, in particular, is bad for lower-income mortgages, which hurts lower income, minorities, and stuff like that because we haven't fixed the mortgage business, and now we're making it worse. There's no real risk in it, not a benefit to JPMorgan, but it hurts this country, and it's very unfortunate.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 No. I hear you on all that. And the mortgage comment you made earlier was about shrinking mortgage growth rates or shrinking the balances of mortgages that you have on the books?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The balance -- well, no. We'll originate but the balances in the books will probably come down. And look, we reserve the right to change that. But that's a portfolio decision. And if it doesn't make sense to own mortgage, we're not going to own them.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yes. And would you reduce the buffer? I mean, in the past, Jamie, you've talked about, hey, as these required capital ratios increase relative to the risk in your business staying more consistent than you've said before, that you may operate with less of a buffer. Could you unpack that a little bit?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We're going to keep a buffer -- I'm not even sure what the SCB means at this point. We're not going to go below any regulatory minimum. And if we have to, we'll just drive down credit more to where we got to create. It's a terrible way to run a financial system, and we owe you more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much -- what I think is so much excess capital.




 It just causes a huge confusion about where you should be doing your capital. But keep in mind, one thing, we're earning 70% of tangible equity. We can continue doing that. The company is in great shape. We're going to serve our clients and manage the hell out of the rest of the stuff. We still think we have great businesses and stuff like that, and that's what we're going to do. Most of this stuff doesn't create any additional risk at all. It just creates capital.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst All right. Thank you.




OperatorThe next question is coming from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on expenses. If I kind of look at the first half with the slowdown in investment banking, I think you're annualized less than $76 billion, but you're still targeting $77 billion.




 Is that implication of just higher investment spend in the second half or just uncertainty around getting the pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Jim. Good question. We've looked at that, too. It's definitely more of the former than the latter. In other words, $77 billion is the number that we see right now and the number that we believe. And we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense, including deal, M&A closing and adding to the run rate as well as continued execution of our investment plans, resulting in increased headcount, probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on. So I wouldn't draw any conclusions about lower than $77 billion based on the first half numbers.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK. Great. And then just maybe on credit. It continues to look, I guess, very good, whether it's on the consumer side or commercial side. Are you -- we don't really see it, but are you starting to see any initial cracks in credit or strains in the system?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Look, I think the short answer to that question is no, certainly not in any of our reported actual results for this quarter. The place that everyone --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Excellent.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Right. Exactly. Obviously, running still well below normal levels from the pre-pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the magnification of the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segments and early delinquency roll rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn down of excess cash is a little bit faster there. Buffers are still above what they were pre-pandemic, but coming down, and that absolute numbers for the typical customer are not that high. And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre-pandemic levels, but getting closer in the lower income segment. So if you wanted to try to look for early warning signals, that's where you would see it. But I think there's really still a big question about whether that's simply normalization or whether it's actually an early warning sign of deterioration. And for us, as you know, our portfolio is really not very exposed to that segment of the market. So not really very significant for us.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Right. So prime is still holding up quite well? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Even better.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please proceed.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the point about managing the balance sheet and capital and RWAs. How do you think about your ability to manage the RWA output and dimensionalizing how, if at all, it might impact either the net income or outcome or the ROTCE outcome as you look forward?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it. I can think we do without affecting our ROTC targets and stuff like that. Obviously, it will affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit of stuff like that. But all told, we're going to imagine how it will be fine.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Got it. OK. That's a fair point. And then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit. Obviously, you've got the denominator increase in there, too, and spend versus land. Can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath Card revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Sure. So on card revenue rate, we've said that we thought 10% was a reasonable number for the full year, and it's running a little bit lower right now. And I think the current level, but where is it, Michael? 9.6 or something is probably the right number for the full year at this point.




 And really, the difference is driven by a couple of factors. The main one is that while the growth in Revolve is basically still in place, our view that we would see normalization and Revolve balances happening toward early -- beginning of next year. The starting point of that did get slightly delayed by omicron by about six weeks. And so that, all else equal's a little bit the headwind relative to what we'd expected, but still obviously very robust.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Can you just add a little bit on -- because I know I'm harping on mortgage a little here, but I just want to explain it. Because -- if you go to Europe, OK, the capital held against mortgage is like a fifth what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage that and standardize risk-weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So there are a lot of ways to manage it. And we don't have the no-securitization market today. So our view would change if there was a securitization market might do something different. But by not owning it, buying it, sign it, hedging it, swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk of returns. And so it's unfortunate because I think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our clients.




 Our job is to serve clients through thick or thin, good or bad with what they need, how they need it. And now we spend all the time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. So, yes, and just to finish on card. So slightly lower NII just from the omicron delay. And that slightly better-than-expected new client acquisition is a driver there. And then there's some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thanks a lot.OperatorThe next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. Good morning.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Mike.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Could you help me reconcile your words with your actions? After Investor Day, Jamie, you said a hurricane is on the horizon. By today, you're holding firm with your $77 billion expense guidance for 2022. I mean, it's like you're acting like there's sunny skies ahead. You're out buying kayak, surfboards, wave runners just before the storm. So is it tough times or not?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Let me -- we run the company. We've always run the company consistently investing, doing this stuff through storms. We don't like pull in and pull out and go up and go down and go into markets, out of markets through storms. We manage the company, and you've seen us do this consistently since I've been at Bank One. We invest, we grow, we expand, we manage through this to and stuff like that. And so -- and I mentioned to all of you on the media call, but there are very good current numbers taking place. Consumers are in good shape. They're spending money. They have more income. Jobs are plentiful. They're spending 10% more than last year, almost 30% plus more than pre-COVID. Businesses, you talk to them, they're in good shape. They're doing fine. We've never seen business credit be better ever like in our lifetimes. And that's the current environment. The future environment, which is not that far off, involves rates going up, maybe more than people think because of inflation, maybe elation, maybe soft -- there might be a soft landing.




 I'm simply saying, there's a range of potential outcomes from a soft lending to a hard lending, driven by how much rates go up, the effective quantitative tightening, defective volatile markets. And obviously, this terrible humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the war and then the effect of that on food and oil and gas. And we're simply pointing out, those things make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different. It's not going to change how we run the company. The economy will be bigger in 10 years. We're going to run the company. We're going to serve more clients. We're going to open our branch. We're going to invest in the things, and we'll manage through that. We do -- if you look at what we do, our bridge book is way down. That was managing certain exposures. We're not in subprime fundamentally. That's managing your exposures. So we're quite careful about how we run the risk of the company. And there was a reason to cut back on something we would, but not only we think it's a great business. It's got great growth prospects.




 It's just going to go through a storm. And in fact, going through a storm, we will -- that gives us opportunities, too. So I always remind myself the economy will be a lot bigger in 10 years. We're here to serve clients through a thick or thin, and we will do that.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst So clearly running the company for the next 5 to 10 years. If we have a recession in the next 5 to 10 months, how does technology help you manage through that better, whether it's credit losses, managing for less credit losses, expenses, more flexibility or revenues may be gaining market share? What's the benefit of all these technology investments if we have a recession over the next --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Mike, I think we gave you some examples at Investor Day, for example, AI, which we spend a lot of money on, we gave you a couple of examples, but one of them is we spent $100 million building certain risk and fraud systems so that when we process payments on the consumer side, losses are down $100 million to $200 million. Volume is way up. That's a huge benefit. I don't think it wants to stop doing that because there's a recession. And so -- and plus, in a recession, certain things get cheaper, branches are enormously probable. Bank are enormously probably. We're going to keep on doing those things. And we've managed through recessions before. We'll manage it again. I'm quite comfortable to do it quite well. We stop starting on recruiting or training or technology or a branch, that's crazy. We don't do that. We've never done that. We didn't do it in '08 and '09. And then for [Inaudible] in terms -- yes.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst The only other thing is just market revenue is a lot weaker, right? I mean, the market outlook is worse. And so we know you've had a structural spending. So when all else equal, that would be a little bit less then.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer But that's – yes. That's very performance based too. And again, Mike, the way I look at it a little bit in 15 years, the global GDP -- or 20 years, the global GDP, global financial assets, global companies, companies over 5 -- a billion dollars' worth will all double. That's what we're building for.




 We're not building for like 18 months.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Operator




The next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, guys. Jeremy, you touched on the deposit commentary a short while ago. Can you elaborate on QT and the impact that you've seen? Now granted that I know June was not full QT of $95 billion a month. But can you guys give us a flavor? And I think, Jamie, you mentioned that -- if I heard it correctly, that maybe $300 billion to $400 billion of deposits could outflow over time, I am assuming due to QT. But can you guys elaborate what you saw in June? Is it tracking the way you think it's going to be? And any further outlook for what the deposits could be over the next 12 months due to QT?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Gerard, so as you know, QT just started. So I think it's not the sort of thing where you can say I expect this exact outcome and then sort of track it sector by sector because you can see the clear impact on systemwide deposits, but that also interacts with RP and TGA and stuff like that. And so how that flows into the banking system and then to any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer segments is kind of a tricky thing. So it's early on that. But at a high level, in your comments to what Jamie said before are right. The story remains true, which is that depending on how QT interacts with RRP and loan growth, in particular, you could see some decline in deposits in the banking system, and we would see our share of that. But we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily come out of the nonoperating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base. While in consumer, while you could, in theory, have a little bit of a headwind there, we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the strength of the franchise and the ability to take share.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Very good. And then as a follow-up, I don't believe you guys disclosed the outstandings in the bridge book. But two questions. And, Jamie, you've been very clear about this for the last 10 years, how you've derisked the balance sheet, and you mentioned that already today. Can you just give us some color on how different it is today from '08, '09, just so investors know that it is meaningfully different. And second, what caused the write-down in the bridge book this quarter?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So if you go back to '07, I think, the whole Street, bridge book was $480 billion. I think the whole Street bridge book today is under 100 or under 100.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. It's like 20%.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Our percent of that bridge book has come down substantially just in the last 12 months. And that's really just underlying loan by loan by loan, and you win some, you lose some. And if you guys look at high-yield spreads and stuff like that, bonds are down 6%. That's what you see.




 So you have some flex. You don't have some flex. And we're big boys. We know that, and there are write-downs of a couple of bridge loans. They're not huge. They're just -- I think they were in the investment banking line.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. It's in the IB revenue line, and there's a small amount in the commercial bank as well. But as you said, Jamie, and as Daniel also mentioned at Investor Day, I think we made conscious choices here to dial back our risk appetite and accepted some share losses in leveraged finance. So we feel good about where we are.




 We're still open for business for the right deals at the right risk upside on the right term, absolutely, but we've been careful.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. Thank you.Operator




The next question is coming from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Hi. I just had a few follow-up questions. The first is on balance sheet management. Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on Slide 3, did that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billion-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out nonoperating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was there as well, please?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Erika. Sure. So first point, you have to turn over your magnifying glass. But if you look at Footnote 5 on Page 3, you can see that right at the end of there, it assumes flat RWA in the projection. So -- and I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be, and you've heard Jamie's comments on that. But if you look at the table above, you see that you've got the usual moving parts. We've got organic loan growth that we want, that's been profitable on its own or part of important relationships that we'd like to see continue to happen. Some of it is a little bit positive. We can't really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like VAR. And then there's the mitigation piece of it, which we're going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I said before, on lower returning, lower client excess or boat. So across those three bits, we'll see how it goes.




 But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here. In terms of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that I said before and that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we'll see how it goes.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Got it. And my follow-up question is for Jamie. Jamie, we've heard your caution about the economy. And I think there's a bigger debate on how the U.S. consumer is going to be impacted in light or in context of a downturn. The statistics that Jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy starting point for the consumer that you bank. And the reserve build for loan growth in card and the less than 2% loss rate in card lead us to believe that your consumer is still OK. As you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes, how does the U.S.




 consumer perform? Because it feels like that's the big wildcard, and we've seen the journal term a job for recession. I just wanted to get your thoughts there.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So, first, I just want to point out that on that chart, that's not a forecast for what it is going to be at the end of the quarter. So we're going to -- if you're going to pencil some of your miles, it's 12.5% on December 31, and it'll probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And because obviously, we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer -- it's like a broken record, the consumer right now is in great shape. So even we go in a recession, they're entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they've been -- did in '08 and '09 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful. Now, of course, jobs may disappear.




 Things happen. But they're in very good shape. And, obviously, when you have recessions, it affects consumer income and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it's exceptional. But again, we're adults in that. We know that if you have a recession, losses will go up. We prepare for all that, and we're prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We're not going to just immediately run out of it. And so I think it's great the consumer is in good shape. And it sounds excellent that I'd like the fact that wages are going up and keep at the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentiful. I think that's good for the average American, and we should applaud that. And so they're in good shape right now.




Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks for that.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. The next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I guess just one for -- a couple of follow-ups, Jeremy. In terms of the markets have gone very quickly from pricing in a ton of rate hikes to potentially pricing in rate cuts next year, just talk to us like how that's informing your ALCO balance sheet management as you think about hedging downside risk from lower rates 12 to 18 months out? Like should we expect you to add duration or do anything synthetic to protect against lower rates?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We're going to keep that to ourselves.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Yes. But I don't know, maybe if you want a little bit of general color about how we're thinking about the portfolio. I do think -- yes, OK. I'll keep it brief. The -- on duration, I think at this level of rates, also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10-year yields. The question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us. Then the other piece of it is whether there's the opportunity to deploy cash into non-HQLA securities broadly into spread product. And obviously, the spread product is more attractive right now. But as we've been talking about a lot on this call, the priority right now is to build capital. So that will be something for later, I would say.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I should just point out, the forward curve has been consistently wrong in my whole lifetime. We don't necessarily make investments based on the forward curve. And second, we've always told you that we use the portfolio and other things to manage the broad range of outcomes, not just to try to add NII. So if you said add NII next quarter, yes, we could do that. That would be managing the broad outcome of potential outcomes here, which is to protect the company through all possible outcomes.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 That's helpful. And just one follow-up on credit. I heard your comments on the consumer if we enter some version of a mild recession, like if you had to pick one or two areas, where do you think losses would be driven by? Is it on the commercial side? Is it CRE? Like how do you expect that downturn to kind of play out?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Did you -- I think at Investor Day, you had a chart that showed through-the-cycle losses?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So, I mean, I would just go back to that and we show -- we think through-the-cycle, loss would be for credit cards, C&I and a bunch of other things. And obviously, through-the-cycle is an average, and you can kind of double that from -- OK.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. And that showed exceptionally low losses in wholesale. So whether or not that's a prediction of the future or not, but yes.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you.Operator




The next question is coming from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi. Sorry about that. I somehow got disconnected. Sorry if I missed this, but if we think about provisioning or reserving for a moderate recession, what's the best guess on how much that might be? I think for COVID, it was around $14 billion ex CECL. But obviously, you alluded to the consumer being better. The loan mix has changed. There's lots of puts and takes, but how would you frame kind of total reserve sales to moderate [Inaudible].




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let me state very simply for you. In COVID, we got to 15% unemployment within three months. And in two quarters, we added $15 billion, which we can easily handle. That is clearly -- I was put that almost out of the worst case. It will clearly be a lot less than that. And you guys can look at the things yourselves. Every 5% is another $500 million or something like that, if you change your odds, and so on --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. I mean, we think the current reserve, the current allowance, we think, is conservatively appropriate for a range of scenarios. And as you know, it's already kind of skewed to the downside and there are probably some other elements of slight conservatism in there. So we'll see how it goes. We feel that it's appropriate and conservative at this point.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. And then separately, you've got about $14 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, most of that flows back to capital as the bonds mature. What's kind of some good rule of thumb in terms of how quickly that comes back if rates stabilize here?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 10 basis points a year of CET1, yes.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Right. 10 basis points, you said?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer 10 basis points of CET1 a year.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. OK. Thank you.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer After -- yes, after tax.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Basically, five years is -- it kind of bleeds back in over five years.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Its weighted average life of four or five years, yes. So the good rule of thumb on constant rates is about 10 basis points of CET1 accretion a year.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thank you.




OperatorAt the moment, there are no further questions in the queue.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Folks, everybody, thank you very much, and we'll be talking to you in a quarter.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q1 2022 Earnings CallApr 13, 2022, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2022 earnings call. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63, and revenue of $31.6 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in credit adjustments and other in CIB. Regarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter ex PPP, with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength. On Page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of 31.6 billion was down 1.5 billion, or 5% year on year.NII ex markets was up 1 billion, or 9%, on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex markets was down 2.2 billion, or 17%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower home lending production revenue, losses in credit adjustments and other in CIB, as well as investment securities losses in corporate. And markets revenue was down 300 million, or 3%, against a record first quarter last year. Expenses of 19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million, or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were 1.5 billion for the quarter. We've built 902 million in reserves, driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures, and CIB in AWM. Net charge-offs of 582 million were down year on year and comparable to last quarter and remained historically low across our portfolios. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 3, our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter.




 As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption, as well as some pickup and seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position as well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 4. CCB reported net income of 2.9 billion on revenue of 12.2 billion, which was down 2% year on year. In consumer and business banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter, consistent with the last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year on year, largely driven by flows in addition to market performance. In home lending, revenue was down 20% year on year on lower production revenue from both lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of 24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%. Moving to card and auto, revenue was down 8% year on year, primarily on strong new card account originations leading to higher acquisition costs.




 Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in auto, originations were 8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%, Touching on consumer spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year on year, with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of 7.7 billion were up 7% year on year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of 4.4 billion on revenue of 13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment banking revenue of 2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year on year. We maintained our No. 1 rank with a wallet share of 8%. In advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Debt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leveraged finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA. Moving to markets, total revenue was 8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat, driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity and a volatile market. Equity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year.




 This quarter, however, was our second best, with robust client activity across both derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of 524 million, driven by funding spread widening, as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty-related, not trading, it appears in the credit adjustments and other line where it contributed about 120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VAR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings. Payments revenue was 1.9 billion, up 33% year on year, or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments, driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances, and higher rates. Security services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 2% year on year, driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of 7.3 billion were up 3% year on year, mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Moving to commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of 850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of 2.4 billion was flat year on year, with higher payments revenue and deposit balances offset by lower investment banking revenue. Gross investment banking revenue of 729 million was down 35%, driven by both fewer large deals and less flow activity. Expenses of 1.1 billion were up 17% year on year, largely driven by investments and volume- and revenue-related expenses.




 Deposits were down 2% quarter on quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at yearend. Loans were up 5% year on year and up 3% quarter on quarter, excluding PIP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle market and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of 1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 30%. Revenue of 4.3 billion was up 6% year on year, as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year. Expenses of 2.9 billion were up 11% year on year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments, as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of 19 billion were positive across all channels, with strength in equities, multiasset, and alternatives. And in liquidity, we saw net outflows of 52 billion. AUM $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year on year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter on quarter, with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%. Turning to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of 856 million. Revenue was a loss of 881 million, down 408 million year on year. NII was up 319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down 727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year, as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter.




 Expenses of 184 million were lower by 692 million year on year, primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year. Next, the outlook on Page 9. We still expect NII ex markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color in investor day next month. So, to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts, and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE, and rising rates, as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: Operator




Please stand by. And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. I was wondering about the net interest income outlook. I know it sounds like we'll get more in investor day, but it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February. And obviously, rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of color on what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex markets outlook?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good morning, John. Good question. Yeah, look, obviously, given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting priced into the front of the curve, we would actually expect the excess part of in excess of 53 billion to be bigger than it was at Credit Suisse. So, you know, to size that, you know, probably a couple of billion dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. We -- you know, there have been very big moves, and we're going to want to get it right. And so, we'll give, you know, more detail about that at investor day.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. And as my follow-up, could you give us some thoughts about the markets related at NII? What things should we think about there, whether it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I guess I would direct you to my comments, I think one or two quarters ago, on this. But generally speaking, that number is pretty correlated to the short-term rate. So, you know, all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through, which, you know, in general, on the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR.




 But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of, you know, obscure balance sheet composition issues, as I've mentioned in the past, you know. And so, that's why we don't focus too much on that number.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, John.OperatorAnd the next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 All right. Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, just wanted to follow up on your comments about capital and, you know, being able to provide room for organic growth. You know, with 5.2 SLR, 11.9 CET1 versus your longer-term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just, you know, saw in the first quarter? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks. So, let me just give some high-level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So, as you know, we went into the quarter with elevated buffers, knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA-CCR.




 And so, of course, that happened. And, you know, we would have expected roughly to be at 12 .5, right in the middle of the range for this quarter. Of course, it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways. And so, we saw RWA inflation from market risk, which we've talked about. And the AOCI drawdown and, you know, a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9. From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are, in fact, going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So, we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obviously come back over time. And probably, most importantly, you know, to the prior question, the higher rate outlook is -- it's improving the revenue outlook, which will, of course, accrete to capital. Um, so then if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the G-SIB requirement in the first quarter of '23 coming in. And then there's the question on SCB, where, you know, we don't know, obviously. But given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed's scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, you know, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So, I guess to summarize, when we put all this together between improved income generation, some of the denominator decay effects, and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as new information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums, you know, evolve.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst And just a follow-up there, too, is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like, you know, adding preferred to help bridge the gap? Or is it just going to be enough to organically build back with, you know, possibly, you know, just utilizing less buybacks will allow things to just grow back?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I think the -- I guess, in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments are callable and, you know, we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations. So, I think that's an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves.




 But from where we sit today, with the numbers that I'm looking at, you know, we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thanks, Jeremy.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yup.OperatorThe next one is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Hi. Good morning.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 I had a question for Jamie. In your annual letter, you've mentioned how you expect to achieve double-digit market share over time in payments. And when I -- what I wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit, because when I look at payments, you've got a lot of different sleeves. For example, in consumer credit cards, you're at 20%, 25%. In Treasury, I think you're at 7%. So, could you give us a sense as to where you think you are in this total payments category you're talking about, what you're expecting in terms of drivers to get to double-digit, and what kind of timeframe you're thinking about there. Thanks.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, so, Betsy, so that number, the double-digit relating just to wholesale payments, not to consumer payments, which, obviously, we already have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit north of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building out -- and I gave some examples, and I'll give a lot in the investor day coming up. We're building all the things we need, real-time payments, certain blockchain-type things while it's the -- just a couple of acquisitions.




 They're building out our wholesale capabilities to do a far better job for clients globally around the world and supported by, what I would say, very good cyber-risk control, which clients really need to, by the way. So, it's kind of across the board. There's nothing mystical about it. But it's an area we want to win in.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. And getting to double digits is over, you know, the same kind of time frame with the same pace going from 4 to 7? Or you think you can accelerate that --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah, I wasn't --Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Because I see what's --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I wasn't meaning to put a time frame up, but I would say five years. But you'll get more update on this in investor day.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. And then just the follow up here is, on the NII outlook, where you indicated, you know, the curve suggests the plus side and, you know, is it a couple of billion? And I guess the question I have is, you know, historically, you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You know, you did that last cycle as well. You know, what I hear -- what I'm hearing is that, you know, maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at investor day.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 No.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Is that a fair takeaway or not?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 No. No. No. That's --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No. No.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 We don't look at it that way like we're reinvesting NII. We -- the investing stuff, we look at all the time we're investing. And, you know, we're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why, as you're saying, as --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think fundamentally, you know, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about, at the time, some short-term headwinds to that, mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's, you know, reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks for -- Thanks for that.OperatorThe next question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hey, good morning. So, I wanted start off with the question on QT. In the past, you've spoken about the linkage between Fed balance sheet reduction and deposit outflow expectation for yourselves in the industry. And with the Fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path for balance sheet reduction, how should we be thinking about deposit outflow risk? Any views on how data may differ versus last cycle, given a more aggressive pace of Fed tightening?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Steve. So, this is a fun question, so let's nerd out a little bit. I'm sure Jamie will jump in.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And then I'll simplify it for you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So, look, I think we've talked a little bit about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So, you had QE and then you had big expansion in bank deposit systemwide expansion. And then at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in, and then RRP has gotten sort of quite big as QE finished. And so, now as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink.




 But I think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize that there's a lot of interacting forces here. And it's really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen here. And just to outline a couple of those. So, it's worth noting for starters that, in general, industrywide loan growth outlook is quite robust. And that should be a tailwind for systemwide deposit growth. So, as you note, yup, QT will start in May and all likelihood for the minutes headwind. Then, you just have to look at what's going to happen on the front end of the curve, particularly in bills. So, the Treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage of short-dated collateral in the market right now. So, you know, that might argue for wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so, those things are going to interact in various ways. I think one thing that's worth noting, though, is that if you wind up in a state of the world where bank deposits drained sooner than people might have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower-value, nonoperating-type deposits. So, you know, in any case, we'll see.




 But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company. And just pivoting away for a second from the system to us, you know, from a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in wholesale, you know, we've had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So, that's the current thinking on that topic.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, the answer is we don't know. OK? And you guys should read economist reports. But the fact is, initially, it probably won't come out of deposits. Over time, it'll come out of wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us in the short run. And the beta, effectively, we don't expect to be that different than it was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and minuses.




 You can argue a whole bunch of different ways. But the fact is it won't be that much different, at least the first hundred-basis-point increase.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst No, that's really helpful color. Thanks for allowing us to nerd out with you guys on that. Just one more topic or a follow-up, I should say, Jamie, just in the shareholder letter, you had spoken about how the market's underestimating the number of Fed hikes that might be needed to curb inflation. What's your expectation around the level of Fed tightening? I know it's difficult to make such predictions, but maybe if you could just help us understand, given your own rate outlook, how that's been forming, how you're managing excess liquidity, given the significant capacity that you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher-yielding securities.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah. So, I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. And look, no one knows. And, you know, obviously, everyone does their forecasts. I think it's going to be more than that, OK? I can give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and just about deposits. And we've never been through ever QT like this. So, this is a new thing for the world. And I think it's more substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people, you know, change their investment portfolios. So, I think we're going to be fine because we're going to serve to help our customers and gain share. So, you'd say, what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase will be fine. We got plenty of capital, plenty -- with all great margins. We've already had the returns we want and all the things like that. So, you know, I would just be cautious. I think what you should expect is volatile markets. Again, that's OK for us, you know. And the Fed -- you know, we think the Fed needs to do what they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst And then the appetite to deploy the excess liquidity?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, don't expect that.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. OK. We can leave it there.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst OK. Thanks so much.




OperatorThe next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions for the -- to capture that downside risk in CECL assumptions. Just because what I want to get to is where we came from, where we're at now, and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter as we go, just --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL, OK? I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of a severe adverse event at 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did. Very basic. And that led to big --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 It really is that simple, Glenn.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we don't know -- and it's a guess. You know, it's probability-weighted hypothetical, multi-year scenarios that we do the best we can. But to spend a lot of time on earnings calls about CECL swings is a waste of time. It's got nothing to do with the underlying business. Charge-offs are extraordinarily good, matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, you know, middle market, 1 basis point; credit card, 1.5. We would have told you the best it'll ever be is 2.5. So, credit's very good.




 That will get worse. NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And, you know, obviously, you have -- yeah.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst I -- the 10% is what I wanted because your guess is better than my guess. So, that -- I appreciate that.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't -- Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. Um, well, I mean, pinky bet. So, I think you might have just answered, but I want to make sure I ask it explicitly. The follow-up I have on credit and I know it's in much better shape and it depends on the go-forward, but are you seeing any stresses in the levered parts of the debt markets, meaning levered loan, high-yield CLO private credit.




 Anything in there that makes you like turn a side-eye?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just a spread widening and a little bit less liquidity.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 It doesn't sound so bad. And maybe the last one --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. You know, I mean, Glenn, I think -- look, we -- no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to steer on the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in that kind of spot metrics, so to speak.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and there's wage inflation and excess cash, are there any buckets, you know, of income that you're seeing the early stage delinquencies picking up?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer In short, no. You know, it is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in card and, you know, sort of the heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so, we're watching that, especially in the kind of LMI segment of our customer base. But right now, we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 OK. Thank you for all that.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Glenn.Operator




The next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hey, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Jeremy -- hi. Can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves? I think you said it was $902 million that, you know, you guys built up, and it was due to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is it because you're concerned about the lower-end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that may lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And how much was that due to the Ukraine situation?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Glenn, it's really a lot more general than that. So, just to repeat 900, build; 300 name-specific, primarily related to Russia-associated individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a, you might call it, Volcker-style, Fed-induced recession in response to the current inflationary environment, which, obviously, is in part driven by commodity price increases, which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine. So, but it's not, you know, a super micro portfolio level thing, except to the extent that our models, you know, handle that. It's a top-down modification of the probabilistic ways.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we spend a lot of time at every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Understood. And then, as a follow-up, Jeremy, if we look at the AOCI number that you gave us, and you were very clear about it, you know, it's going to accrete back into the capital as those securities mature, two things, is there anything you can do, assuming if the long end of the curve continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on AOCI as we go forward? Is there anything you can do to mitigate that, whether to shrink that, you know, the available-for-sale portfolio, which looks like it was $313 billion at the end of this period? Or do you just have to grow the revenue, as you pointed out, as another way of growing your capital?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think that, obviously, we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes, there are some things that can be done to mitigate this. But the big picture is that the, you know, central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage.




 And if things don't play out as along the lines of the central case, we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so --Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Thank you.Operator




The next one is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. I have a question for both Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, I guess the SLR 5.2% close to the minimum, you explained that. But since quarter end, AOCI probably has gotten worse. And I'm guessing your SLR might be very even close to that minimum. So, I understand your central case, it's fine. Your outlook is good. But at what point do you say you stop buybacks? Or do you think you'll buy back maybe half of the $30 billion authorization? Or does JPMorgan even put on asset caps, given just the amazing asset growth over the last three months? So, that's my question for Jeremy.




 But the bigger picture is for you, Jamie, your CEO letter. The takeaway was in the eye of the beholder. Like, Jamie was really worried about a recession this year, now he's not. So, the first question certainly ties into the second. So, Jeremy, plan for buybacks, stopping at asset cap. And then, Jamie, your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK, Mike. So, let me take this capital one. So first, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing.




 I think that's a distraction, and the terminology is unhelpful. Then, in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So, 5.20 is actually still pretty far away from 5%. And, of course, there are relatively easy-to-use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier. In addition, I do think it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, you're subject to a 60% restriction, which, based on our recent historical net income generation, still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So, you know, it's obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there. And then, in terms of buybacks, just a reminder that the $30 billion authorization is a, you know, nontime-bounded SEC requirement. It's not the old CCAR standard. So, it's just a signal that we want to have that capacity and that flexibility. But it doesn't really say that much about how much we're actually planning to do in the near term.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Are you allowed to say what you're planning to do in the near term? Like, just in -- like, if you're kind of like half the level last year, do you think you can keep that? Or does this slow down? Or you're not giving guidance?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, let's talk about buybacks for a second. So, in the kind of post-SCB world, we haven't been guiding a lot on the pace of buybacks, mainly because, as you know, they're at the bottom of our capital stack. So, we're focused on investing in the business, providing capital to support growing RWA, acquisitions when they make sense, etc. And buybacks are an output. As we have discussed, in the current environment, the rate of buybacks is clearly going to be less than it was in the 2021 period as a result of the interaction of all those effects. And that's a good thing. It means that we have better uses for the capital.




 And if things evolve one way or the other, then the rate of buybacks will be an output. But it's one of the tools in the toolkit.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Mike, I would just add, you know, if you look at liquidity and capital, it's extraordinary. And we don't want to have buffers on top of buffers. So, we're going to manage this pretty tightly over time. And obviously, we have AOCI and earnings and CECL, all that, but being conscious of all of that, we can manage through that. And we've done some acquisitions this year. And so -- and plus, we are adding -- we're planning to have more capital for the increase in G-SIFI down the road, which reduced stock buyback and -- but the amount -- I look at the amount of liquidity, the earnings, the capital, that's the stuff that really matters. And at the end of the day, it's driving customers. You know, we serve customers, which is why we're here. We don't serve managing SLR. That's kind of an output of stuff we do. And so -- and then, your question about -- I think it was about recession basically. Yeah, do you want to repeat the question, Mike?Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Yeah. No, I mean, if you read your CEO letter, and that's great. You're the chief worry officer. You're the chief risk manager. You're bringing up all the things that, you know, keep you up at night, which is great. But you can read it one way and say, ""Hey, Jamie and JPMorgan thinks there's going to be a recession this year."" And you can read it in other way, saying, ""Hey, things are fine, but these are some tail risks.""Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst So, do you think -- and I'll repeat what Glenn said. Your view is better than mine, and I'm not going to accept anything else. You have a lot of people, a lot of resources. Do you think the U.S. is going to have a recession this year based on everything you know?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah, I don't. But I just want to question this. First of all, I can't forecast the future any more than anyone else. And, you know, the Fed forecasted and everyone forecasted, and everyone's wrong all the time. And I think it's a mistake. We run the company to serve clients through thick or thin. That's what we do. We know there will be ups. We know there will be down. We know the weather is going to change and all that stuff like that. What I have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth, right now, which will go on. It's not stoppable. The consumer has money. They pay down credit card debt. Confidence isn't high. But the fact that they have money, they're spending their money.




 They have $2 trillion still in their savings and checking accounts. Businesses are in good shape. Home prices are up. Credit is extraordinarily good. So, you have this -- that's one factor. That's going to continue in the second quarter, third quarter. And I -- after that, it's hard to predict. You've got two other very large countervailing factors, which you guys are all completely aware of. One is inflation/QE-QT. You've never seen that before. I'm simply pointing out that we've -- those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not. That's a fact. And I'm quite conscious of that fact, and I do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines and stuff like that. And the second is war in Ukraine. I pointed out in my letter that, you know, war in Ukraine. Usually, wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run.




 But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them. I don't -- I'm not looking at this on a static basis, OK? So you're looking at this war in Ukraine and, you know, sanctions there. Things are unpredictable. Wars are unpredictable. Wars have unpredictable outcome. You've already seen in oil markets. The oil markets are precarious, OK? So, I pointed that out over and over that, you know, people don't understand that those things can change dramatically for either physical reasons, cyber reasons, or just, you know, supply demand. And so, that's another huge cloud in the horizon, and I -- we're prepared for it. We understand it. We're just -- I can't tell you the outcome of it. I hope those things all disappear and go away. We have a soft landing and the war is resolved, OK? I just wouldn't bet on all that. I just, you know -- and, of course, being a risk manager, we're going to get through all that. We're going to serve our clients, and we're going to gain share. We're going to come to that earning tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thank you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You're welcome.




OperatorNext one is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst I was hoping you guys could comment on the -- there are some articles on the nickel exposure and how the losses could have been significant if the trades hadn't been canceled and from the actions that were taken. And then, just as a follow-up, you guys have talked about kind of looking at that business and reevaluating how you think about some of the outsized risks, and maybe you can update us on that process.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We've already told you. We're helping our clients get through this. We had a little bit of loss this quarter, we're going to manage through it. We'll do postmortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later. We're not going to do it now.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 And then, I guess, I mean, more broadly speaking, you know, given what we just saw where it was probably a several standard deviation event and kind of, as you mentioned, markets might do more of these unusual things, like, does it make you step back and look at other portfolios, other businesses and try to reduce the next --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer In my life, I've seen so many 10 standard deviation events to be shocked.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah, exactly. Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, obviously, we're aware of that all the time in everything we do.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. And I would take it one step further. I think the whole paradigm of saying it's a 10 standard deviation event is naive, right? We know the returns are not normally distributed.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 We know that. Regulators know that. The capital framework recognizes that in a broad variety of ways, including things like stress. So, I don't think -- of course, you can't predict where and in which asset class and in which particular moment you're going to see these types of fat tail events. But the framework recognizes in a range of ways that that's the case. And that's how we manage risk, and that's how we capitalize.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, we do CCAR once a year, as you guys see. But, you know, we actually run a hundred different various stress tests every week with extreme movements and things. You know, and that's what we do. And, you know, we're always -- you're always going to be a little surprised somewhere, but we're pretty conscious of those risks.




 And all events like this, we always look at -- but it doesn't have to happen to us. It can happen to someone else. We still analyze everything that, you know, maybe we were on the wrong side of something, too. But at the end of the day, in all of our businesses, we are here to serve clients all the time. That means taking rational, thoughtful, disciplined risk to do that.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And then, just separately, you had mentioned earlier that you weren't looking to deploy large amounts of your liquidity. And I guess, the question is, you know, you might get the rate benefit just from Fed funds going up, but is there an opportunity to accelerate that benefit just by moving some cash into shorter-term treasuries?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst We've obviously had a big move in --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Guys, we're just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than 3%. Convexity is going up. AOCI is going up. All these -- there are all these various reasons not to do that. We're not going to do it just to give you a little bit more NII next quarter.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. And, Steve, to just go one level deeper there for a second, right? So, you talked about deployment. Of course, as Jamie says, we're always going to take relative value opportunities in the portfolio. You know, mortgage spreads have widened. There's interesting stuff to do. So, in that sense, yeah, deployment out of cash into various sorts of spread product that looks more interesting. We do that all the time. The high-level simple question of buying duration, you know, as Jamie says, balance sheets extended a little bit. That was never -- we were never planning to do that much of that anyway. And, you know, frankly, given the timing and expected speed of the rate hikes, increasingly, it just kind of doesn't matter that much. And yeah, so I think it's helpful to keep that in mind.Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 OK. Thank you.OperatorThe next question is coming from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Hey, good morning. Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about the trajectory of loan growth from here, where you're seeing the biggest pockets of strength. And specifically in cards, is the significant year-over-year growth driven more by slowing paydowns? Or is that increasing demand or a combination of both? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. So, you'll remember in the fourth quarter that we talked about the outlook based on sort of high single-digit loan growth for the year. And, you know, this quarter, we've roughly seen that. Interestingly, it's a little bit more driven by wholesale this quarter, which sort of brings us to your question of card. So, overall card loan growth is reasonably robust when you adjust for seasonality and so on. And that's really primarily driven by spend, which, as you know, is very robust. The question inside of that is then what's going on with revolve. And I think our core revolve thesis of getting back to the pre-pandemic levels of revolving balances by the end of the year is still in place to a good approximation.




 At the margin, we probably saw the like takeoff moment delayed by six weeks or so because of omicron. But some of that's reaccelerating now. We see that in some of the March numbers. So, we'll see how it goes. But also, just a reminder that, you know, there's a very, very close linkage between what we see in revolve and what we see in charge-offs. And so, in the moments where revolve is lagging potentially, certainly, that was true throughout the pandemic period relative to what we thought. We also saw exceptionally lower charge-offs. So, on a bottom-line basis, the run rate performance, there's significant offset there. But the core thesis is still there. Spend is robust. We are seeing spend down and some of the cash buffers in the customer segment that tends to revolve. So, more or less, as anticipated, I would say.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 OK. And then, maybe just on -- skipping over to trading. Clearly, a stronger quarter, must have finished off strongly in March. So, any confirmation of that? And how do we -- you know, if you're expecting more volatility around Fed in QT, is it -- should we be thinking that this could be a better than normalization year? How are you thinking about trading, I guess, going forward?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, you know that we're going to be reluctant to like predict the next three quarters of trading performance. But --Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Yeah, I could try.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, obviously, yeah. But just to your point about normalization, right? We've been saying that, of course, we expect some normalization. The question is, if you define normalization as a return to kind of like 2019-type trading run-rate levels, we never expected that because there's been a bunch of organic growth in the background, some share gains. And we had said that as we emerge from the pandemic and monetary policy normalized, that was going to add volatility to the markets. And that, you know, with any luck and good risk management, that would net-net help a little bit to mitigate what we might otherwise expect in terms of the drop from the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic. So, obviously, there are some particular things that played out this quarter. But one of those was more volatile rate market, and that helps a little bit. So, yeah, all else equal, the much more dynamic environment right now would mute the normalization you would see otherwise.




 But our core case is still that the pandemic-year period market's performance is not repeatable.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I'll just add to that. I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets going forward. We've already spoken about the enormous strength of the economy, QT, inflation, war, commodity prices. There's almost no chance you would have volatile markets. That could be good or bad for trading.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer But [Inaudible] chance it won't happen. And I think people should be prepared for that.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst All right. I appreciate the color.OperatorThe next one is from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning. I guess just one more question on the macro outlook. I guess we can debate whether or not we get into a recession over the next year. But, Jamie, would love to hear your thoughts around as we think about just the medium term, do you see a better capex cycle for the U.S. economy? We've heard a lot about reshoring, labor productivity, how companies are dealing with it. Just given the lens you have in terms of large corporate and middle-market customers, do you see some pent-up demand for capex spending that's going to be a big driver of growth, maybe not for the next six months, but as we think about the medium term next few years?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes, in general because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that, yes, and generally see capex going up. And I forgot the exact number. You're better off looking at our great economist forecast for that than asking me. And we see in the borrowing a little bit of --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, we do see a pretty nice loan growth in the commercial bank. I mean, there's a bunch of different factors there. It could be some inventory effects and so on, but, you know, we'll see. But, yeah.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 And just on that front, like, have you seen any improvement in supply chains? And how big a setback was the Russia war to supply chain improvements?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's very hard to tell. There was some improvement and then there was Ukraine. And now, it's all mixed again. So, it's hard to tell.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Got it. And just one follow-up around you launched the U.K. digital bank last month. Any early wins in terms of how that's playing out? Any perspective on what the markers are as we think about how that strategy plays out? I'm sure you're going to talk about that at investor day, but just wondering any early thoughts.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We'll leave that to investor day.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q4 2021 Earnings CallJan 14, 2022, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to J.P. Morgan Chase's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. This call is being recorded [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to J.P. Morgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum. Please go ahead. 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. It's slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year. Starting with the fourth quarter on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $10.4 billion, EPS of $3.33 on revenue of $30.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 19%. These results included a $1.8 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Adjusting for this, we delivered a 17% ROTCE this quarter.Touching on a few highlights. As we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a pickup in loan growth, 8% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter, ex-PPP, with a significant portion of this growth coming from AWM and markets. But we're also seeing positive indicators in card, as well as increasing revolver utilization in C&I. And it was an exceptionally strong quarter for investment banking, particularly M&A, as well as another good quarter in AWM.




 On Page 2, we have some more detail on the fourth quarter. Revenue of $30.3 billion was up 1% year on year. Net interest income was up 3%, primarily driven by balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower CIB markets NII. And NII was down 1%, largely driven by normalization in CIB markets and lower production revenue in home lending, mostly offset by higher IB fees on strong advisory. You'll notice that we've added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show NII and NIR, excluding markets, as well as the third line of stand-alone markets total revenue, which, as we said before, is more consistent with the way we run the company. We'll be keeping this format going forward, and you'll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook. If you look at things on this basis, the drivers are the same, but the numbers are a little different. NII, excluding markets, is up 4%. NIR, excluding markets, is up 3%. And markets is down 11% on normalization. Expenses of $17.9 billion were up $1.8 billion or 11%, largely on higher compensation. And credit costs were a net benefit of $1.3 billion, reflecting reserve releases. Looking at the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $48.3 billion, EPS of $15.36 and record revenue of $125.3 billion. We delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23% or 18%, excluding the reserve releases. And then, on to reserves, Page 4.




 We released $1.8 billion this quarter, reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment. Our outlook remains constructive, but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 5. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up slightly, and reflecting nearly $5 billion of capital distributions to shareholders, including $1.9 billion of net repurchases. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 6. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion, including reserve releases of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $12.3 billion was down 4% year on year and reflects lower production margins in home lending and higher acquisition costs in card, partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer and business banking. Many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter. Deposits were up 20% year on year and 4% sequentially. And client investment assets were up 22% year on year, about evenly split between market performance and flows. Combined, credit and debit spend was up 27% versus the fourth quarter of '19, with each quarter in 2021 showing sequential growth compared to 2019. Within that, travel and entertainment spend was up 13% versus 4Q '19, though we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the Omicron wave. Card outstandings were up 5% year on year but remained down 8% versus 4Q '19. However, it's promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in May of 2021, since then, they've kept pace with 2019 growth rates. In home lending, loans were down 1% year on year, but up 1% quarter on quarter as prepayments have slowed. And it was another strong quarter for originations, totaling $42.2 billion, up 30% year on year.




 In fact, it was the highest fourth quarter since 2012, driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes. In auto, average loans were up 7% year on year and up 1% quarter on quarter. After several strong quarters, the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to $8.5 billion, down 23% year on year. So overall, loans, ex-PPP, were up 2% year on year and sequentially, driven by card and auto. And expenses of $7.8 billion were up 10% year on year on higher compensation, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing. Next, the CIB on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, net income was $21 billion on record revenue of $52 billion. Investment banking revenue of $3.2 billion was up 28% versus the prior year and up 6% sequentially. IB fees were up 37% year on year, primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory. And we maintained our No. 1 rank with a full year wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, we were up 86%, and it was the third consecutive all-time record quarter benefiting from elevated M&A volumes that continued throughout 2021, specifically from mid-sized deals. Debt underwriting fees were up 14%, driven by an active leveraged loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 12%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs. Moving to markets.




 Total revenue was $5.3 billion, down 11% against a record fourth quarter last year. Compared to 2019, we were up 7%, driven by a strong performance in equities. Fixed Income was down 16% year on year, reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter, especially in rates, as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies, emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equity markets were down 2% on $2 billion of revenue as continued strength in prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives. For the full year, equities revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22% and an all-time record. It was a particularly strong year for both investment banking and markets. And looking ahead, we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in 2022. However, for purposes of the first quarter in investment banking, the overall pipeline remains quite robust. Payments revenue was $1.8 billion, up 26% year on year or up 7%, excluding net gains on equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was from higher fees and deposits, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Securities services revenue of $1.1 billion was flat year on year. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 18% year on year, predominantly due to higher compensation, as well as volume-related and legal expenses. And credit costs were a net benefit of $126 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront. Moving to commercial banking on Page 8. Commercial banking reported net income of $1.3 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.6 billion was up 6% year on year on record investment banking revenue, driven by continued strength in M&A and acquisition-related financing.




 Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 11% year on year, largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were up 8% sequentially on seasonality. Loans were down 1% year on year and up 2% sequentially, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 4%, ex-PPP, primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased short-term financing and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 1%, with higher new loan originations, offset by net payoff activity. And credit costs were a net benefit of $89 million, driven by reserve releases, with net charge-offs of 2 basis points. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 9. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16% year on year as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3 billion were up 9% year on year, predominantly driven by higher performance-related compensation and distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $34 billion and, for the full year, were positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, totaling a record $164 billion. AUM of $3.1 trillion and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion, up 15% and 18% year on year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 4% quarter on quarter, with continued strength in custom lending, mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 15% sequentially. Turning to corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. Revenue was a loss of $545 million, down $296 million year on year.




 NII was up $160 million, primarily on higher rates, mostly offset by continued deposit growth. And NIR was down $456 million, primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments. Expenses of $251 million were down $110 million year on year. So with that, as we close the books on 2021, we think it's important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the COVID period, and then pivot to discussing the 2022 and medium-term outlook. So turning to Page 11. What stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period, especially when you strip out the reserve build and subsequent releases in 2020 and 2021. If you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom left-hand side of the page, you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits. NII, ex-markets, was down nearly 20% on the headwinds of lower rates and card revolve that we've discussed throughout the year. This was partially offset by significant NIR growth, ex-markets, largely from higher IB fees and AWM management and performance fees. And we also saw strength across products and regions in CIB markets as the extraordinary market environment in 2020 did not normalize as much as we expected in 2021. So when you look across the company, we saw consistent modest revenue growth, as well as good performance in the areas that we control, notably, staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively resulting in quite stable returns, once again proving the power of the J.P. Morgan Chase platform. So turning to the next page. The strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that we're prepared for the long term. On the left-hand side of the page, you can see the expense drivers from 2019 to 2021. The first bar is structural.




 And while the growth of 2% is modest over the two-year period, that includes some COVID-related effects that we would see as temporary, including, for example, lower T&E spend and elevated employee attrition. And we do expect some catch-up in those effects as we look forward. Then the middle bar is $3.4 billion of growth in volume and revenue-related expenses. Some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation, primarily from investment banking, markets and asset and wealth management, the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance. And remember, we've seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in AWM and CCB. So don't assume all of this is CIB as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets and fee, well, it goes one way, and AUM goes the opposite way. And then, this bar also includes volume-related noncomp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees, some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they're offset with revenue gross-ups. Then the last bar of $1.7 billion, as previewed with you this time last year, is a result of our investment agenda, which we've been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our long-standing priorities. You can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the right-hand side of the page, $9.6 billion growing to $11.3 billion across the categories that we've often discussed. We're continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network. Then marketing, where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a full year spend comparable to 2019. And tech, which we've broadened to include tech-adjacent spend, reflecting our recognition that tech means more than just software development. It encompasses data and analytics, AI, as well as the physical aspects of modernization, such as data centers. And what's really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments, which are quite significant in dollar terms and are designed to secure our future, while still delivering excellent current returns. So over the next few pages, let's double-click into some of these investment areas to see what we're doing, starting with examples of marketing and distribution on Page 13. We've expanded our reach across the U.S.




 and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous 48 states, an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans. We also continue to expand internationally, including 13 international markets as part of our commercial bank expansion, China in both our CIB and AWM businesses, and in the U.K. with Chase U.K., where we've seen exciting progress since we launched in September, although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall. We continue to hire bankers and advisors in investment banking, private banking and wealth management, really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint, where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share. And as I just said, the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the company. So we're not making short-term claims about share outcome causality, but as you can see at the bottom of the page, our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the company. Turning to Page 14. In addition to all of our distribution-related investments, a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology, where we spend over $12 billion annually, with about half of that being investments or, as we sometimes call it, change the bank spend. It's important to understand what's in the investment category. About half of that is foundational and mandatory, which includes regulatory-related investments, modernization and the retirement of technical debt, in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future. On the left-hand side, you can see some more detail around this. Modernization, which includes migrations to the cloud, as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture; data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary data set by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it; attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills; and a product operating model, which is, obviously, a popular buzzword these days. But if you look through all that, it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with end-to-end ownership. Underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the firm and our clients and customers, as well as maintaining a sound control environment. Moving to the right-hand side. The other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our client-facing products.




 We believe it's critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience. And we're attacking the problem with a combination of building, partnering and buying. And so, a few examples of that. On the retail side, we've been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like Chase MyHome and launch a cloud native digital bank with our recent Chase U.K. launch. On the wholesale side, we've continued to innovate on our execute trading platform, commercialized blockchain through Onyx and are building out real-time payments capabilities. In addition, our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies. And you can see several examples of this on the page. So taken together, our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there, whether we're the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale. With that, let's talk about the outlook and the year ahead, starting on Page 15. As you'll remember from Daniel's comments in December, the 17% that we have talked about as a medium-term ROTCE target is not realistic for 2022. We do expect to see some tailwinds to NII, including the benefit of the latest implieds and the expectation that card revolve rates will increase. But the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet, and we continue to make additional investments, as well as the impact of inflationary pressures. However, despite these potential challenges for the near-term outlook, we do continue to believe in 17% ROTCE as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher, and we realize business growth, driven by our investments. So let us try to give you more detail around forward-looking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds. So first, the rate curve.




 Our central case does not require a return to a 2.5% Fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in 625-basis-point hikes over the next three years. Assuming we realize the forward curve, from there, we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric, with plus or minus 175 basis points of ROTCE impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case. And of course, there are, obviously, any number of rate paths to get there, which could produce different outcomes over the near term. In this illustration, the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates, whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve and more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience. And of course, what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on NII. But for the performance of the company as a whole, credit matters a lot. And the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that. In markets and banking, we feel good about the share we've taken. And there are reasons why the beginning of a rate hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular, at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of post-COVID revenue normalization. In our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021 and resume modest growth thereafter. The downside case assumes a return to 2019 trend line levels with sub-GDP growth rates, whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels. As we've been discussing in consumer, the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moments of the pandemic was the lower level of card revolve even as spend has started to return. In our central case, we assume healthy sales growth on the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions. And that, combined with relatively constant revolve rates, generates a strong recovery in revolving balances. But there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior, which could be a source of downside. And in that scenario, revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the long-term pre-pandemic averages, resulting in approximately 50 basis points of downside relative to our central case.




 Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster, but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside. And then, let's touch on inflation for a second, which is, obviously, increasingly relevant. On balance, modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us. But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit, which could represent around 75 basis points of downside. And while it's not on the page, another key driver is capital, where, even though we remain hopeful, our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher CET1, reflecting that we finished the year in the 4.5% G-SIB bucket, which equates to a 1% increase from G-SIB in the central case, although, as a reminder, that does not become binding until 2024. This is a good opportunity to point out that QE deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxied by GDP growth of the factors in the original 2015 rule release, combined, represent two full G-SIB buckets. So in the absence of those, we would still be in the 3.5% bucket. With that in mind, any recalibration could be a tailwind. And each 1% change in the CET1 level is worth about 150 basis points of ROTCE. And to be clear, for simplicity, we've assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page. So when we take a step back, 17% remains our central case in the medium term. But over the next one to two years, we expect to earn modestly below that target. In light of all that, let's talk about near-term guidance on Page 16. We expect NII, excluding markets, to be roughly $50 billion in 2022, up approximately $5.5 billion from 2021. As I mentioned upfront, this is a change relative to how we've previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of markets' NII can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottom line neutral. Looking at the key drivers of that for 2022, there are a few major factors.




 Rates. With the market implieds suggesting approximately three hikes later this year and the recent steepening of the yield curve, we would expect to see about $2.5 billion more NII from that effect. You can see at the bottom right, we've shown you the third quarter earnings at-risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10-K, reflecting the year-end rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition. And as we note in our quarterly filings, there are lots of reasons to be careful in trying to use EIR to predict NII changes under real-world conditions. But at a high level, if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and what's happening to the yield curve recently, you should find the $2.5 billion increase relatively intuitive. Then balance sheet growth and mix, where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to 2019 levels, and also benefiting from securities deployment toward the end of 2021 and into 2022. And partially offsetting both of those factors is the roll-off of PPP. So while we do expect NII to increase year on year, depending on the path of rates, it may take a couple of years to return to the full NII-generating capacity of the company. Turning to Page 17. As we said at the outset of this section, we are in for a couple of years of sub-target returns. Despite this, we are going to continue to invest, and we're not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions. And so, looking at adjusted expenses, we expect roughly $77 billion in 2022, an increase of about $6 billion year on year or 8%. And before we go into the breakdown, it's worth noting, while the year-on-year increase is eye-catching, a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post-reopening trends from the second half of 2021 across various categories. So starting with the first bucket on the page, which is the structural expense increase. As I alluded to earlier, we are seeing some catch-up this year, both from the impact of inflation and our compensation expenses, as well as higher noncomp expense with the resumption of T&E, then volume and revenue-related expenses. Remember that this is both comp and noncomp.




 From a comp perspective, to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues, there should be a tailwind here. But keep in mind a couple of points. The normalization assumption for markets and IB fees at this point is pretty modest. And our assumption for AUM is for modest increases. At the same time, we have the impact of volume growth on noncomp, both in wholesale and in consumer, which is offset by lower auto lease depreciation. And most importantly, we are adding another $3.5 billion of investments, which, I would note, includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions, as well as some of the run rate effects that I just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones I discussed earlier. As I wrap up, it's another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earnings-generating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the company. So in closing, on Page 18, we're happy with what we've been able to achieve over the last two years, not only the business results, some of which are highlighted here on the page, but also continuing to serve our customers, clients and communities, and importantly, executing on our strategic priorities. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the long term. And while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic, we've never felt better about the company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape. So with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: Operator




[Operator instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please proceed.Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, and it's on Page 16, and it's a two-part question on this guidance. The first is, could you help us size the timing and magnitude of deposit beta that you presume in this $50 billion number, as well as the size of securities deployment? And the second part to that question is, clearly, we're missing that white box, right, in terms of CIB markets' contribution. And if you could give us sort of rails to think about CIB markets in light of your comments about more modest normalization versus the idea that this business is naturally liability sensitive? Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Right. OK. So three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta. At the end of the day, the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we're assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So I think, the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn't before. So that could, at the margin, make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different, especially with some of the neo bank entrants, and that could go in the other direction. So it will be what it will be. But for the purposes of the guidance, we're assuming a reprice experience that's similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously, deployment is going to be a situational decision. But if you're looking at the $4 billion bar on Page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in card.




 And then, in terms of markets NII, the whole point of not guiding explicitly to markets NII is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there, which can come from a lot of really kind of irrelevant places, like interest rate hikes in Brazil and cash versus futures positions, which is the example I'd like to give. But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there's a couple of things we could suggest. So if you look at the supplement, we've actually been disclosing the markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you regress that thing against the Fed funds rate, you'll actually see that there's a pretty clear negative correlation there. And so, you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly, even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So it's sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection. Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Very clear. Thank you. My second compound question is on capital, if you could give us an update. I know that January 1 is the adoption for SA-CCR.




 If you could give us an estimate on the impact to CET1? And just to clarify, that 17% medium-term ROTCE does take into account that your G-SIB surcharge is 4.5%?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So that does mean 4.5% G-SIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 million of standardized RWA. So I think, if you do the math, that's like 10 basis points of CET1.




Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorOur next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please proceed.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hey, Jeremy, I want to follow up on that. Maybe a broader discussion on how you're managing the capital constraints, these SLRs and the rising G-SIB. And what does it mean for balancing share buybacks, which, obviously, reduced this quarter, preferred issuance and other levers that you have?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So as you know, John, in terms of share buybacks, that's at the bottom of our capital stack. So to the extent that we're seeing robust loan growth, other opportunities to invest in the business, as well as potential M&A opportunities, those are all going to come ahead of buybacks. And so, I don't want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year, which, under SCB, as you know, are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes of the capital build.




 But you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth and the minimums that we see in the future, as well as the loan growth, as well as some of the investments that we are making. And frankly, we're kind of happy about that. That's just -- we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. And then, as the follow-up, maybe compound follow-up. The new CET1 target, or where you expect to kind of run this year, if you could clarify that. And also, any color on the modest normalization of the FICC and equities wallets that you could flush out? Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So in terms of the target, I mean, I said previously that 12% was not off the table, and that remains true. Depending on the outcome of the rule side, depending on the Basel 3 end game, depending on all the various components, you can see a world where 12% remains the minimum. But as you can see, and as I said in response to Erika a second ago, the 17% target assumes something closer to 13% as a function of the expected increases in G-SIB and some other factors. So we're kind of going to operate in that type of range throughout the year with, obviously, the flexibility that we have. And then, sorry, you also asked about normalization of markets and IB fees. I mean, I would say, if you would asked in the middle of the year, we were talking a little bit about thinking that a reversion to 2019 run rate was a thing that like could happen in theory. The way we feel right now, our central case is, obviously, that we will see some normalization from exceptionally strong performance, both in IB fees and in markets. But I think, we're expecting that normalization to be a little bit less, like we are near all the way down to the 2019 levels, partially because the banking pipeline is really very robust. We feel good about the kind of organic growth in equities and some of the share gains there. And then, in fixed income, we've already seen a decent amount of normalization there actually. And as the monetary policy environment evolves next year, that could actually create some tailwinds for that business. John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 Thank you.OperatorNext up, we have Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Thank you very much. I wonder if I could ask a little follow-up on the expense side. Slide 17 breaks a lot out. First, I'm curious on -- if I overgeneralize and say, 40% used to call structural comp normalization and a 60% investment -- and thank you, I just saw a further breakout in the bottom of the slide. But the question I have is how much of that 60%, the higher volume, the investments, has investments made? In other words, you made 11 either M&A deals or investments over the last like 15 months. How much of that is related to that coming through the P&L? Or straight-up brand-new investments for '22 entering for all those items that you listed below?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Right. OK. I think, I get your question, Glenn. So number one, to the extent that we've done some M&A over the last 15 months, as you allude to, and that that has introduced some expenses into the run rate, the run rate impact of that is in the $3.5 billion.




 It's a relatively modest contribution. On the top of my head, I want to say it's probably like $300 million or something like that. So it could be a little bit more, depending on some factors. So that's one point. The other point is that there are different types of investments here. So if you look at, for example, the change in the marketing expense and the marketing investments that come through marketing expense in card, a lot of the decisioning of that actually happened as part of the reopening in the middle of the year. So that's actually already in the run rate. Whereas, other aspects of the investment agenda are, obviously, thinks that we're executing now, expanding in places, hiring people, hiring technologists to do things that we need to do. So hopefully, that answers your question. Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 Thanks. And maybe if I could just ask a very general question. I think, people get normalizing capital markets and a higher investment spend, then that adds up to falling short of the 17%, over time, target. The question -- the simple question I have is the fact that you've mentioned multiyear shortfall, is that a function of timing of NII going full run rate with the timing of capital markets, sort of, and the higher generator, as you just answered with John's question? Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, your line is breaking up a tiny bit, but I think I basically hear your question. And I think, the simple answer is yes. So in other words, we're sort of saying that as we -- as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways, so that includes policy rate normalization, rate curve normalization, as well as run rate normalization and markets revenues, with the sort of some background expectation of growth in our markets and investment banking revenues. With the background expectation of growth, and when all of that plays out and is finished playing out, we believe we should be back to 17%, all else equal. So the -- you can kind of see -- it's not that long, if you know what I mean, in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Glenn, I would just like to add, we don't really know about 2023. And I'd be very cautious in that, plus I expect more interest rates increases than is in the implied curve. And obviously, the world is very competitive. I also want to point out that a 17% return on tangible equity, if we can get that for the rest of our lives, would be exceptional. So reconfirming that that's kind of what we think we can do is pretty good. By the way, I would say 15% on tangible equity for the rest of my life, if I can guarantee that. Operator




Next up is a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you just a couple of more questions on loans. You mentioned that you're starting to see some better activity. I wanted to just ask if you can kind of just flesh out what you're seeing across corporate lending, commercial lending, noticing that the wholesale-related commitments were actually down 3% sequentially. So can you kind of just talk us through what clients are saying and doing? And just how strong can that rebound on the corporate and commercial side could we see as we go forward?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yes. So in terms of C&I loan growth, as I said in the script, we are seeing an uptick in revolver utilization rates, especially in the commercial bank. And it remains sort of skewed to the smaller clients. But we are starting to see an uptick in that, actually, even in the bigger clients. So that's, I guess, an encouraging sign. One of the things I've heard from the folks who run those businesses is that one driver of that is CEOs and management teams, who've been burned by low inventory levels as a result of the supply chain problems, wanting to run higher inventories. And that is maybe driving higher utilization there which, as a result, while it would, I guess, theoretically be a relatively permanent increase in utilization, it is not a thing that you can sort of project forward in terms of compounding the growth. But at the same time, we're also hearing really quite a bit of confidence in the C-suites and, all else equal, that should be positive for C&I loan growth. But clearly, the levels there are modest still in a world where capital markets have been exceptionally receptive to investment-grade issuance, in particular, and more recently, the high-yield issuance throughout the sort of pandemic period. And so, people are well funded from capital markets issuance. 




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Second question is just on fees. There are a couple of zigs and zags in mortgage banking, securities servicing, which were both down a little bit more than expected, and card did get a little bit better. Can you just kind of give us a little bit of color on the drivers of each of those, please? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So there's a lot of stuff in there. So let me do mortgage and cards. So in mortgage, you'll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on, you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there.




 So there's a few drivers of that. One is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flow-through of the loan-specific pricing adjustments. So that's one factor. In addition, you actually -- we did -- despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter of originations and for funded loans, as we started to see higher rates toward the end of the quarter, we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume and so on. So that's a little bit of a factor. And then, there's the sort of the normal organic dynamics, where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage, with rates selling off a little bit. So you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there, but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy. And though, obviously, with higher rates, we expect things to be weaker next year. We are still predicting a $3 trillion mortgage market next year, which, by historical standards, is very robust. So that's that part. And then, in card, I imagine that you're looking at the card income line, where we had a significant drop last quarter. And this quarter, the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high. So you'll remember that for card income, we had a sort of one-off item last quarter depressing the number. This quarter, we have another sort of one-off-ish type item, which is the impact of the Southwest co-brand renegotiation, which is public. So that's contributing to the card income line and to the revenue rate a little bit. But it's important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization account for revenue expense, which, as you know, amortizes over 12 months.




 And so, as I mentioned earlier, as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement, as part of the reopening in the middle of the year, we ramped that up quite significantly to 100,000-point offers in the market and stuff like that. And so, that's coming through the numbers. So as a result, when you look at the sort of full year revenue rate for card of around 10%, we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset, obviously, by expected growth in NII with the revolve narrative that we've laid out. Next question, yeah.OperatorSir, that question is from Jim Mitchell coming from Seaport Research.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Research -- Analyst




 Hey, good morning. Just -- you guys are doubling the investment spend, so clearly seeing success in the prior efforts. So can you just give us a little bit big picture discussion on what you're seeing from a return on investment standpoint and what time frame? Because I think, you kind of alluded to 2023 still being a little bit subpar in return. So does that mean the payback is a little longer, and you still expect significant growth in investment spend in '23? Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So I mean, at some level, the question that you're asking is this perennial question of how can we be sure that the investments that we're making are paying back and on what time line and how do we measure that? And it's interesting. We were just talking about card marketing. I think of that as a continuum. You have continuum of investments that start with card marketing, where every dollar that we put into a card marketing investment is part of a very sophisticated, extremely data-driven, highly measurable set of decisioning to ensure that all of those are accretive and when we have sort of measurable outcomes in the short term. So there's a lot of science there, and it's pretty precise, and you get feedback pretty quickly. At the other end of the continuum is tech modernization type stuff, which is a big part of the theme right now. And those things are things that are just we, obviously, need to do them.




 If we don't do them, we'll be clunky and inefficient and hamstrung in the future when we're trying to compete. And it's impossible to prove in some narrow financial sense that there is a tangible return payback from that, but we know that they're absolutely mandatory. So when we think a little bit about the revenue outlook in our kind of normalized run rate, we are certainly assuming that many of the investments that we're making now and that we've made over the last couple of years will produce the revenues that we expect in that time horizon. But a lot of what we are doing is not of that nature. And in some sense, those are actually the most important investments because they're the hardest decisions to make. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And some are very basic. Opening 400 branches, $800 million a year, obviously, the payback comes over time. Adding thousands of sales people kind of know pretty much what the payback is, but obviously, it comes over time. And so, it's a whole mix.




 And just think about it is, expenses, you should expect to go up a little bit in 2023.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Research -- Analyst All right. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on -- just on the NII. I think, futures markets are now pricing in the four hikes. I think, you have three in your assumptions. If we do get a four hikes starting in March, is that a material change to the NII outlook for this year in your models? 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So if you look at the bottom left-hand side of Page 16, Footnote 3, an extremely small print, you will note that the implied curve that we use is from January 5. So you can take that curve and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveats that I won't give you and draw your own conclusions. But I mean, it should be a modest increase, modest additional tailwind. Very modest. Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Research -- Analyst




 OK, thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer While we wait for the next question, I said something inaccurate before. I realized I wasn't that confident when I said it. The $40 billion standardized RWA increase in SA-CCR, if you do the math, is obviously, not 10 basis points of CET1. It's 30 basis points of CET1. So correction coming through there. 




OperatorNext, we have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Good morning.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. So a couple of questions. First, on the NII outlook, could you give us a sense as to what's embedded in that with regard to your thoughts on how balance sheet shrinkage at the Fed, right, the QT is going to impact the liquidity pool? And then, how much of that liquidity pool you currently are assuming is going to get redeployed into the more duration in your forward look? 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So I mean, I forgot exactly what the market is assuming about the start of QT at this point, QT2 as they're now calling it. But from us, and I looked closely, there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of QT2. Maybe people are now starting to accelerate that. But in any case, the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering, the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly. And therefore, the impact on systemwide deposit growth should be quite modest this year. And that is -- and our assumptions are consistent with that. In other words, we're not assuming lots of deposit growth next year because, ultimately, that's going to be primarily as a function of the Fed balance sheet size. But obviously, we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of QT, if you know what I'm saying. And so then, in terms of deployment, you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter. It was primarily in the front of the curve. So we're still being quite cautious about really buying duration.




 But -- and if you look at, again, Page 16, you notice that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that $4 billion increase that's tied as balance sheet growth and mix. So it's reasonable to assume that we might be -- we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict, but it shouldn't be too dramatic. Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK, thanks. And then, my second question is just on the investments, the $3.5 billion that you've got incremental here. And I assume that this is built up bottoms up from business unit leaders' requests to do everything that you mentioned in the call. And my question here is what percentage, roughly, like just got numbers, but what percentage are you giving them this year? In other words, if they ask for seven, you're giving them 3.5%, and we should expect another uptick materially in 2023? I know, Jamie, you mentioned 77% is a run rate that we should grow from next year. But I'm kind of asking a slightly different question, which is how much of what they need are you giving them this year? And a subset question is, at what point -- does this fully fund your ability to get into the cloud for U.S. consumer?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. How do you answer that question? We do not sit at the table and tell people you can only do x. We sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do? So think of it, it's 100% within our capability because some things you just simply can't do. You can't attack 14 funds at the same time or something like that. And the -- that's number one. So we want to make those kind of investments. Each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary. Some of them are table stakes. I do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and do NPV. I was like just don't do an NPV. Just get it done. That's just serving your client properly and stuff like that.




 And so -- and like as I said, a lot of you -- I mean, Jeremy mentioned it's 400 branch in the United States. It's 13 sites overseas. It's more countries, more products. It's all the things we should be doing that you would want to do if you owned 100% of the company. So it may not be what you do if you have to meet NII next quarter of X, Y or Z or something like that. And the second part of your question, it wasn't that, it was the consumer digital and stuff like that. We're not going to start giving you real numbers and all that, but that is a march. That's a journey, and it's hard. And we want to get there as soon as possible. Pieces and pockets have already gotten there. So certain applications and certain datasets are already running on the private cloud, somewhere in the public cloud, some parts of the company ahead of other parts of the companies, that's a lot of work. And there is -- you guys have pointed a little bit call it bubbles expression there. We're not going to disclose that either, because then we just got a doctor closing 84 other bubble expenses. Those are our responsibility. And to the extent we have opportunities to do more, we will do more. We have extraordinary capability.




 And I think, I just also want to point out, Jeremy, you mentioned the assumptions around capital. I mean, SLR, G-SIFI, and most of the other -- should be recalibrated, OK? Even the regulars say these things should be recalibrated for the global side, the global economy. If you put capital against treasuries and capital Fed deposits and let's see what happens. So on that, we're kind of conservative. We're not going to be expecting a lot of relief. But even some of the folks yesterday we mentioned that were being questioned prospects were being questioned about SLR, acknowledge that there are issues around SLR that are not good for the markets. Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer And Betsy, the only thing I want to add to that, which I was going to basically say the same thing, this whole like ask for 10 and hope to get five. I mean, we would -- we aim to manage the company much better than that. So I certainly don't have that type of authority. That's not the way it works.




 And I think, the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there. So that's where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to you now, whether it's through our priority now, whether we have the capacity to do it, whether -- in the case of where the returns are measurable, where it's producing the right returns. And that's really part of how we operate the company and part of the discipline of the day to day. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'd like to give you another example. If we can spend $2 billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow, I would do that in a second. All right.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 But this step function that we see this year -- I mean, given the pace of competition and the impact of everything that's going on, it's possible we could see this type of step function again. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's possible. But if it happens, it will be for a good reason. And I've read about the competition. There's global competition, there's nonbank competitions, direct fiber lending competition. There's change street competition, there's pseudo competition, there's fintech competition, there's PayPal competition. There's it's a lot of competition, and we intend to win. And sometimes you guys spend a few bucks.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. I got it. Thanks.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I want to emphasize, too, embedded upon that, as we've always said, we are going to -- we want to be very, very competitive and pay. There's a $1 billion in merit increase. There's a lot more compensation for our top bankers and traders and managers who actually say, by the way, did an extraordinary job in the last couple of years delivering this stuff. And we will be competitive and pay.




 And if that squeezes margin a little bit for shareholders, so be it.OperatorAnd next up, we have Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Hey, good morning. So I want to start off with a question on capital. Cause highlighted in his swan song speech, the potential for Basel 4 implementation, increasing capital requirements as much as 20% for select banks. While we haven't seen a formal proposal from the Fed, I was just hoping you could provide just some preliminary thoughts how you're handicapping the risk of higher RWA inflation ahead of Basel 4 adoption? And to what extent is that contemplated in the updated ROTCE guidance? Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So Steve --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Don't give too much. Is it --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No, no.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 They were like 18 different things to it.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No, it's fine. This is fine. It's a very reasonable question. So OK. So here you go. So when you look at the current state of the so-called Basel 3 endgame or Basel 4 proposals, and you look at the RWA components of them in isolation, you've got the change in the credit conversion factors, which, all else equal, is a tailwind. You've got the fundamental review of the trading book, which is quite complicated and it's going to depend on institution by institution, but it's potentially, for some folks, a headwind. And then, you've got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA.




 And if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way, you will conclude that there's a bunch of RWA inflation. But a couple of things. First, this all takes place in the context of the global regulatory community, or at least, in the U.S., saying that the system has enough capital. And it doesn't actually need more capital. And it's important to realize, which --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer By the way, anyone does any real analysis at all would come to that conclusion. 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, so -- and so it is important to realize, Steve, that as you know, obviously, there are additional tools. So the most important one of which is how the standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA. And then, in turn, how that interacts potentially with the Collins floor, as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak, potential double accounting and the stress capital buffer against FRTB and so on and so forth. So the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall RWA inflation. And the way we see the world, we don't expect the Basel 3 endgame, in and of itself, to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 And you were conservative in saying it's to 4.5% G-SIB.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Exactly. And we are allowing the G-SIFI increases to flow through to the medium-term ROTCE assumptions. Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Thanks for clarifying that and for not punting on the topic of Basel 4. Just for my follow-up here, on payment --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer It's expanded for now. We will very, very aggressively manage those things when we know the actual numbers, like very aggressively manage them.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Fair enough, Jamie. You certainly have a track record that supports that. Just for my follow-up on card payment normalization. How are you thinking about the trajectory for card payment rates? And just maybe to speak to your confidence level that we see card payment rates return to pre-pandemic levels, just given the emerging threats from BNPL that you cited and still elevated personal savings rates? Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So I still, to be honest, get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios. But I think, it's a little bit simpler. If you just take a step back, if you look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that. So there's a few things to note. So the revolve rate, having dropped quite a bit, has more or less stabilized. There's a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some Omicron stuff. But broadly, it's stabilized.




 In the meantime, the growth in overall card loans has now, for several quarters in a row, produced modest growth in revolving card balances. And our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place. So what's important about that is that we're not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the pre-pandemic levels. We're simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth, therefore, contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth. And so, the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to NII growth in 2022 has, very roughly speaking, revolving balances getting back to the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, roughly. And then, sorry, Steve, I think you had another -- was there another part of that question that I forgot? Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst No, no, that's sufficient. That's perfect.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK, great. Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Thanks so much, Jeremy.




OperatorNext, we have Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. As we think about the 17% medium-term target, can you help frame what you think or what's being assumed on the efficiency ratio? And then, maybe on credit costs as well, please? 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So in terms of credit costs, as I said, we're assuming a roughly normal credit environment at that point. So that would mean card charge-off rates back into the sort of low to mid-threes type of thing, as we said, pre-pandemic, we were assuming we would get to, especially as we underwrite some slightly higher loss vintages over time. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And building reserves as the loan books grow. 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Importantly. Yes, exactly. So I mean, I would just broadly describe and consistently with the way we're describing it, which is kind of medium-term guidance in a normalized environment, that the charge-off environment should, in turn, be normal. So that's that. And then, you're kind of asking me, I guess, about the overhead ratio a little bit. So personally, I kind of don't love that measure. I think, it's more of an output than an input. And more often than not, it's driven by revenues, not expenses. And more often than not, in the short term, the revenue number that's swinging is a function of the rate curve. So essentially, the overhead ratio just becomes a proxy for the Fed funds rate, which makes it not a great management tool for the company. But having said that, in the assumptions that we're using to build up that 17% rate, we do get back to something like a 55% overhead ratio. But as Jamie said before, if that number has to go up to deliver the right returns, in the long term, it will.




 Like we don't consider it to be a constraint.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. Then, obviously, the math implies to get back to 55%. You have kind of outside operating leverage for a few years, right? I mean, because I think the efficiency ratio goes the wrong way again in '22 for the couple of years of pretty big operating leverage, right?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 You've got to do your own models, OK?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, for me, op rate, in a world where there are inflationary pressures, there's a lot of post-pandemic effects in the numbers, and we have some critical investments to make. The notion of operating leverage at the level of the company's overall numbers for me becomes just not terribly meaningful. I'm not criticizing your question. I understand what you're asking, but it's just kind of another way, when you think about it.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 OK. And I was just curious, Jamie, you're mentioning -- I still think ready to go up more than expected. Obviously, expectations have moved up quite a bit, and I'm just wondering kind of what's basing that opinion. And it's -- on a high bar, do you think the long end will go up or if it hasn't gone up yet, why will it from here?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, first of all, we prepare for all eventualities here. We're not kind of guessing at one. But the consumer is very strong. And it's all with respect to the fact that people suffering still, on COVID and all that. The fact is, despite of Omicron, in spite of supply chains, 2021 was one of the best growth years ever. And 2022, it looks like it either be 3.5% or 4%, which is actually pretty good. The consumer is $2 trillion more in their balance sheet, their home prices are up, asset prices are up, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up, which is good for them. You know what, we are not against that.




 And sharing the wealth a little bit of America's recovery with everybody so the consumer is in really good shape. There's spending. I mean, Jeremy took you through the numbers. 25% more is mainly pre-COVID. 25% more. And that number drives all the order books for everybody else, whether it's goods and services and, obviously, it's bouncing around between goods and service dollar kind of stuff like that. Businesses equally are in very good shape with care and capability and confidence levels high. What have they seen? They're seeing their order books go up, more cars, more motors, more patios, more home improvements, more homes, more demand. We have a shortage of homes in America. So you see the table is set pretty well with -- for the growth -- with obviously, the negative being inflation and how that gets navigated and stuff like that. And so, my view is a pretty good chance there'll be more than four, OK? it could be six or seven. I mean, I grew up in the world where you -- Paul Volcker raised up interest rates, 200 basis points, on a Saturday night. And this whole notion that somehow it's going to be sweet and gentle and no one's ever going to be surprised, I think, is a mistake. That does not mean we won't have growth. It does not mean unemployment but more to a good position and stuff like that. And the other fact is it may very well be possible that they're long rates, and I'm a little surprised how low they stayed.




 But the long rates may react more to the actual QE and then QT. And so, one point, the Fed is going to be letting run off $100 billion or whatever number a month they're going to come up with. And then, you may see loan rates react a little bit to that. And particularly, I just said about growth and demand for capital and stuff like that that also tends to drive 10-year bond rates and all that. So all things being equal, if you look at the company, and it's very important, we have huge firepower to grow, to expand, to make loans, to extend duration. And you look at capital liquidity, I just want to point out, it's $1.7 trillion -- these numbers I've never seen the bank with them. And you look at percentages, not just gross amounts, $1.7 trillion in cash and marketable securities and $1 trillion of loans, OK? There's $500 million or $600 billion of those cash markets here that could be deployed in higher-yielding assets or loans when -- and if the time comes depending on all these capital constraints and stuff like that, we have to deal with. And those are extraordinary numbers. It's $2.5 trillion deposits. And we don't like taking risky deposits. Those are -- they may go down a little bit in QT and all that. But look at how this balance sheet is funded. I've never seen a bank balance sheet like that. And that's -- think of that as kind of firepower over time as we navigate through the world. And so, we're in pretty good shape. And if I wish I could own 100% of the company be private.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Can I just sneak in? Based on all that, I was thinking like the expense pressure or increase that we're seeing at J.P. Morgan or expect to see in '22, do you think this is indicative of the broader market. As you talk to leaders outside of banks and they see the pipeline of volumes, do you think there's going to be material surprises on expenses for the broader market? Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I would expect that because it was every CEO was talking about wages and certain inflation and stuff like that. But I just -- I don't want to be, as CEO, don't -- please don't say I'm complaining about wages. I think, wages going up is a good thing for the people who have the wages going up. And businesses simply have to deal with changes in prices.




 So if you -- commodity prices go up and down, mozzarella goes up and down, wages go up and down, the CEOs shouldn't be crybabies about. They just deal with it. The job is to serve your client as best you can with all the other factors out there. And so, I'm not opposed to it. But I do think you'll see more people seeing wage pressure, etc., and some have more ability to offset it than others. It hasn't stopped us from doing anything. Zero. None. Nada. We're not cutting back in growth plans or bankers or markets or countries because there was some wage inflation. Operator




Next, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning. Just two very quick follow-ups. One, Jeremy, in terms of capital deployment, just talk to us about inorganic growth. And is there any likelihood that you'll look at any larger M&A transactions to use your currency at any point this year? And should we see a slowdown or a let-up in the pace of inorganic fintech investments that you've been on over the last year? If you could address those two.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 So the large transactions, like over billions, unlikely. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer But we'll always look. We're always open-minded. We're looking all over the place for things that fit in and stuff like that. And then, the pace of fintech investors, stuff like that that won't change at all. Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. For my version of that, which is consistent with Jamie's, is that we continue to be interested in looking at M&A, and we are doing that. Obviously, yeah, very large deals aren't realistic. And the fintech investment part is definitely part of the stuff that we're looking at when we look at deals.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That's helpful. And just double-clicking on something, Jamie, that you mentioned. You've talked about when more square banks leaving the ground open for fintechs over the last few years. Just talk to us, to the extent you can, how are these investments? Clearly, the market is focused on near-term expenses, ROTCE pressures. But talk to us, two years or three years fast forward, how do you feel about JPM as the franchise competing with big tech, fintech head to head?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. But it's battle-engaged. I mean, some of these people do a very good job. I think, there are some things we, your bank, should have done, so we should be a little self-critical. But we have the capability, the economies of scale and all these things. What we're not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target. That's just not even on the card. So -- and we have assets and strengths. Look, the competition is very bright. I mean, they're bobbing and weaving. They're not changing, and they're not static. And I think, sometimes people feel like they're static and they're not static.




 But if we do a good job, like today, on consumer, I'm sure some you saw your Chase customers, free trading, a lot of ATMs. You've got better and better services, more navigation bars, more offers, more travel, more rewards, more -- and you got more of that coming. And we've gotten friendlier on overdraft. We've gotten -- that's just one business. That's true for every single business. So if I look at the way they run and compete with J.P. Morgan, that's going be pretty tough competition. Like take Chase U.K., we've been very, very clear that costs us money. And a lot of you want payback tomorrow and stuff like that. We'll not disclose those numbers, but we are there for the long run. We're going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives, OK? So I doubt, over the long run, we'll fail. We may not do -- we may not become the best digital bank in the U.K. or somewhere in the short run. 




Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorNext, we have Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi, Jamie, I hear that you're ready to do an LBO on J.P. Morgan, that you're so confident? Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think, you would help me raise the equity capital.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out here with -- your -- it's a little frustrating, this call, because the guidance you've given has given all the bad news without any targets. I mean, you're saying we have to wait two years for the 17% ROTCE despite the booming economy. You're guiding for the second year in a row of negative operating leverage. I get it. That's not how you run the company. But $15 billion of investments, that's up one and a half over the last three years. And that $15 billion is enough to capitalize the 11th largest U.S. bank. So you gave us that, but you didn't tell us what to expect from all those investments in terms of what specific market share gains are you targeting? What specific revenues do you expect? When do you expect that? Can you put some more meat on the bones here? Because this is -- that $5 billion of investment spend, look, it worked. You gained share. That $10 billion of investment spend, it worked, you gained share. But now, you're going to $15 billion.




 It might not always work so well. So can you, again, put more meat on the bones? The stock is down 5%. The feedback so far is like you're spending the rate hikes for investments over the next 10 years. That's great. You're in there for the long term, but a lot of the investors aren't planning to invest for a 10-year horizon.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael, I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023, we'll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital. It depends on fixed income markets.




 It depends on a bunch of stuff like that. But every -- so -- but the 400 branches that we're building, those things will get the contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousand bankers we're adding in private banking and Chase wealth management, we are pretty sure we'll get to breakeven but just we expect that takes a couple of years. And so yeah, we can't -- we're not going to tell you all of those things. And Jeremy mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it, and there's a little bit of bubble expense in that. There's even a little bit of bubble expense on the new headquarters. And so, we're pretty comfortable we're doing the right things. And we're being a little conservative. Like Jeremy, you're talking about the card stuff, the return. Yeah, I told our folks that we're getting our card growth this year, but they were so skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing, has $55 billion. I think, Robinhood has, I think, $80 billion the last time I saw or something like that. We're not sitting here bragging about our product because, I would tell you, it's not good enough yet. But it's got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything and or no marketing and no real stuff like that.




 So there's a lot of stuff coming. The competition, we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022. But -- and I mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet. We're pretty conservative in deploying the balance sheet. That may not always be true.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst I'll follow up and then I'll requeue after my follow-up. But as it relates to technology, specifically, Jeremy, you talked about retiring technical debt. And so, that's kind of playing defense, but also on the offensive side. Where are you investing for tech, where you would expect some more revenues? You talked about digital banking in the U.K.




 Are you also going to Brazil? What other countries are you targeting for that?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, it's funny. I wouldn't actually describe retiring technical debt as playing defense. I mean, I think, that's actually a great example of the whole point of this conversation, which is that retiring technical debt is an easy thing to not do if you're applying defense focused on short-term targets. But if you're playing offense for the long term, it's exactly this type of decision that creates some of the frustration that you're articulating that's critical for the long-term success of the country -- the company. So that's -- I mean --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And Mike, to tell you, so we spent $2 billion on brand-new data centers, OK, which have all the cloud capability you can have in private data centers and stuff like that. We're still running the old data centers. Now we are not going to get involved in every time we talk to you, I'll explain every part of the pancake buildup of expenses going in and expenses going out. But all this stuff going to these new data centers, which is now completely up and running, are on apps. Well, some are, but most of the applications that go in have to be cloud eligible. Most of the data that goes in has to be cloud eligible. We're running a whole bunch of major programs, which I don't think we disclosed, on AWS. And we're working with Google and Microsoft to run stuff -- some of the stuff in the cloud because we want to have multiple cloud capabilities. And this year, roughly 30%, 40%, 50% of all our apps and all data will be moving to cloud-related type of stuff. This stuff is absolutely totally valuable. I mean, I can't -- if you sat in this room and look at the power of the cloud and big data on risk, fraud, marketing, capabilities, offers, customer satisfaction, do with errors and complaints, prospecting, it's extraordinary. You actually see some of that already in how we manage stuff.




 Like, for example, with all the fraud and all the cyber and all the ransomware, are forced to close down this year. There's a reason for that. It's because we've deployed huge capabilities in those things. So we have to do those things. And that's a margin that will be hugely valuable for us. And you'll see some of that benefit, which is why we're comfortable that we'll continue to grow and expand and earn. Like I said, with 17% return on tangible capital. I would take that. If I could push a button and give you that for the next 20 years, I would take it. And also, if I did it for the next 20 years, that number would probably be like a big part of the GDP in the United States of America.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 OK. I'll requeue for my follow-up. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I just want to -- Michael asked a very -- another very good question on market shares. We expect to go up in retail deposit market share, investment market share, private banking market share, fixed income market share, equity market share, investment banking market share, global market share, payments market share and securities services and market share, commercial banking market share, and what did I miss? I'd be surprised if any of them go down. And we're not going to give you the number. Operator




As per now, we have one last question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy, Jamie. Jeremy, I'm trying to figure out what the discussion topic is going to be first quarter of 2023 when we talk about fourth quarter numbers. And I think, it might have more to do with credit than we're hearing about on the call today. Can you share with us the underwriting standards that you guys are using compared to what they were at the height of the crisis back in 2020? I'm assuming they're easier today because the economy is stronger. But also, can you compare them to 2019. How does it look today versus what you guys were doing in 2019? 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So I think, broadly for the company, there's no really large change in our credit risk appetite, and therefore, in our underwriting standards. I think, I alluded to a little bit -- I alluded a little bit to this earlier, which is there's a subtlety in the card business, where, if you remember, pre-pandemic, we had talked about card charge-off rates being at 3.25% and maybe trending a little bit higher over time as a function of some underwriting of some slightly higher risk vintages, still well within our credit box, still within our overall credit risk appetite, but just a slight shift in the composition of the portfolio there. So that happened back then, and we just didn't see it flow through because of, obviously, the extraordinary dynamics that we've experienced through the pandemic. And now, we are exiting the fourth quarter of this year with a card net charge-off rate. And I forget the exact number, it was something like 1.2% or something, so.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Which you'll never see again in your life.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Obviously, exceptionally low well. So the question then becomes like -- so -- and then I think somewhere in your question, there was also about like when we sort of leaned into the reopening, how did we modify the credit box and the standards? And the answer to that is that we returned it essentially to the pre-pandemic level. So we were, obviously, very confident in light of what we were seeing about what kind of credit condition for.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 It got tied little bit, and now it's back to where it was it --Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Exactly. Exactly. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 And none of that was completely material to the results. But yeah, one of the things in Jeremy's will -- we've been over earning on credit for years. And we expect that eventually to normalize. You could argue how fast and what time, but credit card has been a number that you've never seen in our lives. Middle market has been lower than ever. Other sales have been lower than ever. Mortgages have been lower than ever. Cards, they're all low. Eventually, they're going to normalize. Eventually, they're -- and then we kind of build that in from months. And the other thing is the loan book. And this is very important. Your own modeling, just assume as the loan book grows, we will add reserves pretty much proportionate to the growth of loan book. All things being equal. We've got CECL and all this stuff like that. But -- so there's -- that's a flip to the negative, obviously, for next year. 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer One item, yeah, and so Gerard, to your point about the fourth quarter of next year, right? I mean, one lens to look at that through is, what do we think the trajectory of normalization of card net charge-offs is through the course of 2022? And I don't want to get into too much specific guidance there, but the numbers that we're putting on the page roughly assume that we get back to that kind of like low threes around the end of 2022 or early '23 in terms of card net charge-offs. So yeah, on the one hand, maybe we'll be talking a lot about the fact that those numbers are going up but they will have actually gone up exactly in line with our expectations.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. And just as a quick follow-up, Jamie, and Jeremy, you talked about the balance sheet, the way it is, today and all that liquidity. And I think, Jamie, you said $500 billion could be put to use. How long will you guys -- will it take you to get to a balance sheet and a mix of business that looks like you would have thought back in 2019 before this whole pandemic started and the balance sheet did what it did?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think, we're in a -- I mean, again, some of those outcomes of decisions you make based on client stuff. But the real fact is we got Basel 4, a lot of changes. And when all that happens, we'll give you a little bit better update how we're going to deploy capital and invest the balance sheet and stuff like that. But we're in no rush to reinvest part of that balance sheet. We'll be very patient. Operator




Mike Mayo have another question. Mike, your line is open. Please proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. Just more detail on the tech spend. And what I asked before was on digital banking, you're going to the U.K. What other countries are you going to? Again, just looking for some more specifics, at least, on digital banking and other tech areas, we expect revenue of pickup, not just -- you mentioned fraud and AML and ransomware and cyber, and that's all -- that's table stakes, as you would say. But as far as actually getting revenue growth from your tech investments, and starting off with digital banking, which new markets are you entering?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So on digital banking, we're not going to disclose specific countries that we're going into one. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There's one we're talking about for next year, I think, just one.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, well, I mean, I think, just to validate Mike's question. As you know, we have made this investment in C6 in Brazil. So Brazil, it's not exactly the same. It's not a de novo build by us, but we're there. We're engaged. It's a significant investment. And Brazil is like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective, and the digital play there is quite interesting. So that's one example. And obviously, we're thinking about additional places to go, and we'll let you know when we do it.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. And the other tech investments where you could expect additional revenues, what would that include? I mean, for example, with your marketing and the degree you're using AI and big data for what kind of improved take rates do you have. Or just again, looking for more specifics where you can provide it.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I'm personally not a big fan of these types of like anecdotal individual like tech stories. I mean, there's cool stuff, like we're doing some AI-enabled lead optimization stuff in AWM, for example. So I could come up with a list of like 20 things like that.




 But in reality, it's really much more about the embedding of the modernization and the digitization of the whole ecosystem as part of customer engagement and competition and making the company more efficient and all that type of stuff. The examples where it's like, I spent $10 million on x that's technology as opposed to like branch build or banker hiring, as Jamie says, and you can then attach a tangible revenue outcome to that. I'm sure we have some of those examples somewhere. I don't have them with me. Maybe we can talk about them next quarter. But I generally think that that sort of gets into a lot of anecdotal stuff that distracts from the big picture.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. Last one. What is your total tech spend again? I thought I saw it in the deck. How much of that is to run the bank versus change the bank? And then, as it relates to the cloud specifically, what do you expect -- as a bold move to move Chase, the core bank to the cloud, what do you expect that to save once that gets done? 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a couple of things. If you go back to my prepared remarks, so it's like $12-ish billion, a bit more 50-50 run the bank, change the bank. And within the change agenda, half again is kind of modernization-type stuff as opposed to features and products. So it gives you a little bit of a --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 And Mike, I'm going to give you one example, which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing. I think, these numbers are accurate. We did this a while ago. Card runs a mainframe, which is quite good. We have one of the most efficient, most economic, 60 million accounts, etc. It's been updated a few years. But it's a mainframe system in the old data center. When it gets modernized, to the cloud, the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be $30 million or $40 million a year. That isn't the reason we're doing it. The reason we're doing it is once you get that to the cloud that the database is that it uses to feed its risk, marketing, fraud, real-time offers and stuff like that become accessible to enormous app and machine learning. So that you can -- when Mike Mayo is going home on a Friday night, we can offer you -- we know what you like to eat at steakhouse, so you can hear immediately offers, and fraud stuff is 10 times what it is today. And so, that's the real value. The value isn't the immediate cost save that you've gone from -- you're saving $30 million running this application a year. I want the $30 million. And the other thing that allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system -- you touch a mainframe system, you've got to be a little careful when you go into it to make some modifications. So like in the old days, you used to modify that mainframe system four times a year.




 Big releases and stuff like that, of course, multiple for multiple reasons. Now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week, every day. And so, that's why it's so important to do this. And it's also -- makes it why it's hard to quantify the benefits and the cost. Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer But Mike, just a big one example, I guess, from a business that I know you know well. If you look at Teresa's securities services business, it's an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy. So in that business, as you know, historically, winning new mandates, especially on services administration, tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expenses as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants. And so, that was typically the dynamic there. And I think, a lot of the investment that we're making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect. So that when we win new business, it's a little bit more accretive. So that's kind of an interesting example of is that tech investment that produces more revenue? I mean, I guess. I would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue, it's more profitable, for example.




 At the same time, we're also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that, which maybe will help us win more mandates. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Like for example, we got to end this call because we've got so many stuff to do. Like just for example, it's an important one, and Teresa stole all the credit for this. We now are using J.P. Morgan's investment banking derivative capability to help clients who use derivatives for custody, to value them and stuff like that. A lot of people simply can't do that. And of course, believe it or not, a lot of portfolios now, they're using more and more what you and I called derivatives as part of the portfolio management. That cost us time. It costs money.




 It's on the cloud. It's hugely valuable to Teresa having a competitive advantage. Folks, thank you very much for taking some time with us. Good luck, everybody. Yes.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q3 2021 Earnings CallOct 13, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorPlease stand by. We're about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to J.P. Morgan Chase's third-quarter 2021 earnings call. [Operator instructions]. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to J.P. Morgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue of $30.4 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%. These results include a $2.1 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly as well as an income tax benefit of $566 million. Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter. Touching on a few highlights.It was another strong quarter for investment banking, including an all-time record for M&A. And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the company and particularly in card. And consistent with last quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy. In fact, net charge-offs are the lowest we've experienced in recent history.




 On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $30.4 billion was up $500 million or 2% year on year. Net interest income was up 1% with balance sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower CIB markets NII. And NIR was up 3%, driven by solid fee generation across investment banking and AWM, largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in home lending. Expenses of $17.1 billion were up 1% year on year on continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses, predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year. And credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion, driven by the reserve release. But it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third-quarter number. Let's cover reserves on the next page. We released $2.1 billion this quarter, driven by less severe downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize. Reserves stand at $20.5 billion, which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID and the current labor market dynamics, including the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.9%, down modestly, primarily on higher RWA. The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter including $5 billion of net repurchases. And the common dividend was increased to $1 per share. With that, let's move on to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 5. CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion, including reserve releases of $950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion, down 3% year on year.




 Deposits were up 3% quarter on quarter, indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are stabilizing. Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked No. 1 in retail deposit share based on the FDIC data and we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth, up 70 basis points year on year. Similarly, client investment assets were up 29% year on year. And while market performance was a driver, retail flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong. Touching on spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 24% versus the third quarter of '19 and in line with last quarter. Within that data, travel and entertainment spend was up 8% versus 3Q '19 and very closely track the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter, softening in August and early September and reaccelerating in recent weeks. card outstandings were up 1% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter, benefiting from higher new account originations. And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs and revolving balances have stabilized. And when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess deposits starting to normalize in segments of the population that traditionally revolve. So as a result, we're optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances. Moving to home lending. Average loans were down 6% year on year, but up 2% quarter on quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly $42 billion, up 43% year on year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market. And in auto, we had $11.5 billion of originations, second only to last quarter's record.




 So overall, loans ex PPP were up 3% quarter on quarter on the growth in card and home lending I just mentioned. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 5% year on year, driven by investments in the business, including marketing. And more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up 10% year on year to almost 45 million. So with that, looking forward, we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends. However, we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic levels given the amount of liquidity in the system. In the meantime, credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinarily low. In card on a year-to-date basis versus 2019, low charge-offs more than offset lower NII. Next, the corporate and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue of $12.4 billion. Investment banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year and down 12% sequentially. IB fees were up 52% year on year, driven by strong performance in advisory and equity underwriting and we maintained our No. 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%. In advisory, it was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity and we almost tripled fees year on year in a market that doubled. Debt underwriting fees were up 3%, driven by an active leveraged loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 41%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy and the M&A market is expected to remain active.




 And if so, IB fees should be up year on year but down sequentially. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year. Notably, we were up 24% from 2019, driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products. Fixed income was down 20% year on year due to ongoing normalization across products, particularly in Commodities, as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio. Equities was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and reflecting higher balances in prime, strong client activity in cash as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives. In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against a record fourth quarter last year but the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22%, or up 10% excluding gains on strategic equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and fees, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels. Expenses of $5.9 billion were flat year on year as higher structural and volume and revenue-related expense as well as investments were offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $638 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront. Moving to commercial banking on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 10% year on year on higher investment banking and wholesale payments revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60%, primarily driven by increased large deal activity with continued strength in M&A and acquisition-related financing across both corporate client and middle market banking.




 Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year on year, predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances and loans were down 1% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were down 3%, but up 1% excluding PPP, driven by higher originations. And it's also worth noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market. And those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels. CRE loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff activity in real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $363 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 6 basis points. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pre-tax margin of 37%. Record revenue of $4.3 billion was up 21% year on year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were up 13% year on year, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation as well as distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $33 billion continued to be positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, with notable strength in equities and fixed income. AUM of $3 trillion and overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year on year, respectively, were driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter on quarter with continued strength in custom lending, securities-based lending and mortgages, while deposits were up 5% sequentially. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including $383 million of the $566 million tax benefit that I mentioned upfront.




 Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion, down $957 million year on year. NII was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $372 million, primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued. And we realized $256 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to $466 million of net gains last year. Expenses of $160 million were down $559 million year on year, primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year. On the next page, let's discuss the outlook. Our full-year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with our previous guidance. We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $71 billion. But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to around 2% as delinquencies remain very low. So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic. The strength of the company, both in terms of our diversified business model as well as our fortress balance sheet, talent and culture, have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients, customers and communities. As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel confident with the position of the company and the strategy going forward. With that, operator, please open the line to Q&A.  Questions & Answers: Operator




And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John, please proceed.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year. It seems to imply a nice step-up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly $13.5 billion. Was wondering what do you expect to be the drivers of that sequential step-up? And would you see the fourth-quarter NII as a good starting point for us to think about our 2022 NII forecast?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah, John. Good question and good catch there. It's true. That is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do the math, it suggest about $350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook for increased revolve and deployment and so on, the increase is not intuitively high. And so just to explain, within that, there are a couple of factors. So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets NII growth between the third and the fourth quarter, which in general, we would sort of encourage you to ignore. And there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness contributing to the fourth-quarter number. So if you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of modest growth, which is a little bit more consistent, I think, with the overall story that we've been telling, which is that the real acceleration in NII, especially from higher card revolve is a 2022 item. In that context then, if you take that sort of lower number and think about annualizing that, I think it's fair to assume that, that would be a sort of lower-end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of especially card revolve. But obviously, we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022 next quarter.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 OK. And as a follow-up, your cash balances continue to grow and you've been conservative on liquidity deployment. Could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment, pacing that and what factors you're balancing?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, totally. So at the highest level, I would say that nothing's really changed, meaning we're still, all else equal, happy to be patient. We still believe in a robust global recovery. We still are a little bit concerned about inflation, I think relative to the consensus. And all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about deployment. But it's also fair to say that relative to last quarter, rates were obviously higher. We start to see central banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit. So the market implied rates are coming a little bit more in line with our view.




 And given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front-end deployment, cash and cash-like activity as well as possibly some duration management.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.Operator




Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Just first on loan growth. As you noted, auto has been strong, cards starting to show signs of life. But it looks like outside of acquisition finance, C&I still seems a little weak and we've got ongoing supply chain issues. So as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing I guess loan demand trends playing out? And what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So let's go through loan growth because obviously, that's one of the areas that everyone is interested in. So if we start with card, which is obviously the one that's going to matter the most in terms of NII impact. As you said, we see some signs of life and we believe that recovery is strongly underway. And it seems, hopefully, like Delta is really fading, so that's going to help. If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality and normal growth there. And the question, really, for card, as we've talked about a lot, is whether that growth in spend and in card outstandings translates into revolve. But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our card customers and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there. So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for card outstandings to grow with higher spend, but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year. It's going to take time, obviously, but that is the core view. In home lending, broadly, we expect that this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue. And then in C&I, which you mentioned, just a reminder, right, that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers, we're eager to lend to them.




 It's a key part of the franchise, but from a financial performance perspective, that's more of an outcome rather than a goal. But we do, as I noted upfront, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates among smaller corporates. So that's kind of consistent with the theme that we've been seeing, which is that the smaller you are and the less likely you are to have had -- to have benefited from the wide-open capital markets, the more likely you are to be borrowing. We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline as we have sort of fully removed any pandemic-related credit pullbacks. And we're leaning into that and we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward. And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets, actually. And we generally discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets. But it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 OK. That's all very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. You and your peers have all seen higher expenses this year, higher capital markets and incentive expense and increased investment spend. But as we think about going into next year, if capital markets activity normalizes as many expect, can we start to see expense growth slow or are there other considerations to think about, whether it's investment spend or inflation pressures that we should think about?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So it's a little bit of an all of the above story, I would say. So first of all, we're still in the middle of budgeting. And it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance.




 We'll do more of that next quarter. But realistically, expenses are going to be up next year. Now, to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance. And in light of the very strong performance over the last couple of years in both banking and markets, we have seen increased compensation expense on the way up. And therefore, as a function of the amount of normalization that you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line, all else equal. Obviously, I would point out that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen through the pandemic is less than a lot of people would have expected actually. And therefore, on the way back down, you would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the treatment of stock-based compensation vesting. So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing. We still see significant opportunities. We still see marketing opportunities in card. And yes, labor inflation is a question. You saw us raise wages in parts of the U.S. at the entry level that just came into effect this September. And as we look out, we see a lot of churn. And as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff. It's normal.




 It's understandable in this environment. But labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us. So when you put all that stuff together, as I say, we'll update you more next quarter. But that's sort of how we see the expense outlook for next year.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK, great. That's helpful. Thanks.Operator




Next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. There are a couple of events during the quarter that I wanted to ask about. And specifically, how has the tech strategy evolved? One, you made the announcement that you're changing the retail bank core system entirely to the public cloud and that's a big change. And Jamie, I would love to hear your comments on that. And then second, your expansion in the U.K. with digital banking, what metrics are you shooting for? And third, your recent fintech acquisitions, to what degree are there synergies among the acquisitions in addition to J.P. Morgan? Thanks




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Mike, hang on, I'm writing down your questions because I don't want to lose track. OK, so let's start with the cloud first. So yeah, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with Thought Machine. At a high level, there's actually nothing new here. We've actually been committed to the cloud for a long time. And by the way, when I say cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public cloud. Our core strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both. And I think that's very important for us as a regulated institution from a resiliency perspective. But the reasons for -- and that's all part of our overall tech modernization road map and a lot of the investments that we're doing that you've heard all the leadership of the company talk about. When it comes to Thought Machine in the consumer space, there are five main reasons why we did that. And it's all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech modernization.




 We want to be able to innovate quickly and bring products to consumers faster. We want to be able to run multiple products on the same platform. As I mentioned, resiliency is critical. Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real time rather than based on batch processes. And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this environment. So that's what I would say about that. Now, yes, please, Jamie?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'll just say this real quick. Thought Machine is basically the core general ledger. It's not all the other stuff around consumer. And when you do these conversions, different than conversions in the past, you can do them -- you can schedule pieces -- do part at a time, not all at once, like a big bank, which we used to have to do when we did big merger and stuff like that.




 So it's a -- I put it as a lower risk for the company, but the core strategy hasn't changed at all.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. And then, Mike, international consumer and acquisitions, I think you asked about. So in terms of international consumer, you will have seen that we launched -- it's obviously early days to give meaningful updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we just rebranded Nutmeg as a J.P. Morgan company just a couple of days ago. So all that's proceeding apace and it seems to be pretty well received. I think the offering is seen as differentiated and innovative. So we'll have more to say about that over time. Generally ...




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Can I just -- again, just to add. This is a 10-year game plan. This is not -- they're going to worry that much about metrics in the next month or two. And with -- this is a long-term work to try to get this thing right, because if we ever going to be retail overseas, it's going to be digital. And so we're going to be very patient. And at one point, Mike, we will report some metrics so you can see them. But they're not going to be material to the firm's numbers for years.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. That's going to take time for sure. So -- but just more generally, in terms of the acquisition strategy, we've talked about this a little bit before. We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down acquisition strategy. I think broadly, we're just doing things that make sense. But there are some themes that you can detect around bolt-on and adding capabilities. Just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG-related capability additions. You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth and it will be a long game, as Jamie says. And then, yes, there's definitely a fintech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the stuff that we've done in the CIB. And then within consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've done, I think, is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers. We've always been very proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the card product. But we think we can take it up even another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and cxLoyalty and stuff like that. So I think I touched on everything there, Mike.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah, you certainly did. And just a follow-up. I mean we see the results. The marginal efficiency in the businesses where you're growing has improved and we just don't have the why. So how much of that is tech driven versus other reasons? I mean I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have. But your marginal efficiency is what or your unit costs are going down or any additional color as to the why the marginal efficiency is improving.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So I mean I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what parts of the expense base you see is a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating. I would have said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think. So the sort of operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue in the capital markets areas in the NIR side, is actually relatively consistent with what I would have expected. But a little bit to your point, Mike, what's also true is that we're a big organization. There's a scale play here. We have a big fixed cost base. And a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that, that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible. And that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible, but that's a long play there.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Just to add, Mike. One of the things as you think about -- one is you -- people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that. We're playing the game for 10 years here. So we're going to -- and we're not going to disclose certain things like margin by product or something like that because it's competitive information. But the long game, we are competing with some very large, talented global players who are not even in banking today. And we are going to compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are more around that than around just what I consider traditional banking. And so -- and my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology. Every year of every month of every quarter, that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the cloud and stuff like that. Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20 years ago.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Got it. Thanks.OperatorNext up, we have a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please proceed.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon card fees and card revenue rate. We all certainly expected the marketing expenses to kind of go up inside that line. And just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter. And just what your general outlook is for the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Ken. So you're right. Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher card marketing spend, which you would have expected as a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth in spending as we emerge from the pandemic.




 And the fact that we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and we're seeing nice growth there. So that's expected. And I think that card marketing number will actually remain elevated and if anything, tick up a little bit sequentially just based on how the amortization there works. So you should expect to see that continue. But in addition, this quarter, we have just an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to the drop this quarter as well. So that is not something that we see continuing. So that should come out of the run rate as we look forward.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Can you help us understand like what the magnitude of that is and what you think about overall card revenue rate going forward?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean as you know, we don't really manage the card revenue rate. So it's not a number that I'm eager to guide to. But I think the -- if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of something like $180 million. So we'll confirm that, but I think that's right.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 OK, thanks. If I might just ask Jamie. You made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing by next year around this time. What are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of the log jams and the potential for that to open up from here?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing. I'm just -- I know that the overfocus over time is so extraordinary sometimes from the press that people forget the big picture. The economy is growing 4% or 5%. What people are buying has changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit. There's not one company I know that's not working aggressively to fix their supply chain issues. Sales are still up, credit card, debit card spend still up, consumers in great shape. And capitalism works.




 I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a year. I just think that we're focusing on it too much. It's simply dampening a fairly good economy. It's not reversing a fairly good economy.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.Operator




Next up, we have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Yeah, two questions. One, just following up on the card discussion that we just have regarding the fees and the $180 million on the -- roughly $180 million on the rewards adjustment. I mean it still leaves us with a pretty big decline q on q. And I'm just trying to think through that a little bit, because I know marketing, rewards, etc., is up. But was there anything in particular that would have driven a one-timer that is unlikely to persist or not? I realize that cash back is a little more expensive. So maybe that's a piece of it and it's a onetime move or is it more a function of, hey, we're going to be ramping our offerings here. And so you should expect that the forward look is a step down from what you had been seeing in 2Q?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So Betsy, in short, it's really the latter. So the only thing that is onetime-ish in nature, for lack of a better term, is the rewards liability adjustment. And the rest of it really is marketing spend and we see that as a critical investment in this moment. It's a moment of high engagement with the product and we're very committed to making those investments. And so that is going to remain elevated and if anything, tick up a little bit as we look forward.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 OK, thanks. And then separately, I think today is the last day of the Vice Chair for Supervision, Randy Quarles' term as Vice Chair of sup and reg. So the question is, how should we be thinking about how you are positioning for an environment where maybe these rules don't change, right, like the LCR, the SLR, other things that we had been hoping might have some changes in them. Should we be anticipating that in order to help deliver the growth that you're looking for? That we should anticipate more pref issuance going forward?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non-risk-sensitive size-based constraints that we'd expected. But we're still hopeful that, that will come soon. We know the staff is hard at work on the Basel III endgame and that's complicated stuff. And it may be the case that some of those things are connected. And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want to deal with the SLR constraint without overissuing and, therefore, being stuck with high-cost prefs that aren't callable for five years. So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our CET1 target right now and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks.OperatorNext up, a question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line. Please proceed.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thanks very much. So in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near term, I heard your comments on payment rates in cards, 4Q seasonality, optimism about revolving card balances. So is there an implicit comment within there about buy now, pay later and the impact it may or may not have? I mean, I'd love to get your perspective on how this old, but I guess new payment option might have on the card industry overall. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So yeah, BNPL, everyone is talking about it. It is funny how layaway is back in the e-commerce checkout lane. But -- and obviously, we're looking at it. Everyone is talking about it. And it's a moment for us as a company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily convince yourself that it's kind of not a threat. We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially fintech-y type disruptions quite seriously. And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've seen, although, it's a relatively small portion of the overall market. I'll remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback on the customer experience there in terms of the kind of post-purchase experience. You can select eligible purchases on the app and then move that to the installment plan, if you want. But yes, we acknowledge that it is downstream of the point of sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there. But even more generally, when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the consumer business here is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth in BNPL. And how can we respond to it in a strategic, holistic way across all of our customers and not sort of too narrowly and too reactively just respond to BNPL? But it's obviously a thing that we're looking at and it's quite interesting.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think it's another example of a fintech company. Because you saw it, a firm come out and it's no longer just about BNPL. They're going to have a debit card and a cash banking account. So these are all different forms of competition, which we have to respond to. And so that's why when we talk about like expenses, we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 I appreciate all that. Maybe one other comment or to get your thought on the right perspective to think about China and Evergrande. And what people care about most is, is there an expansion across border? Meaning, is this contained within their market? Is the funders that will have some marks within their market or do you see any domino effect in crossing borders? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So look, obviously, everyone is looking at Evergrande. Let me start by just saying that for us, in terms of direct Evergrande exposure, it is absolutely de minimis. So that's one piece. As you would expect, we've also looked at sort of more indirect exposures in terms of the broad China property sector as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with to the China property sector. And in general, those exposures are all very modest. So we're obviously watching it closely and continuing to look for read across and do what you would expect us to do. But we're not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us.




 I think in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard. But it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about their three red lines. So it's a process that's being managed. And I would say the better view right now is that it will be contained. But of course, it's the market so we'll see what happens.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thanks for all that, Jeremy. Thanks.




OperatorNext up, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning. I guess, just wanted to follow up on two themes that we discussed. One around fintechs and the regulatory changes, a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies. Jamie, you've talked about in the past in terms of the regulatory arbitrage when you look at big tech, nonbank players.




 I think BNPL is a good example of that. Do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies, they are alert to this arbitrage? And do you think we see a climb down or is it too late for really them to create a framework that would level the playing field?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks. And I think that we just have to compete with what we're -- the hand we're dealt and not expect anything like that. And I think that you're going to have some people clamp down more on banks and maybe some people regulate fintech based on products or services, something like that. But I'm not expecting any relief.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Got it. Yeah. And I was wondering if there would be increased scrutiny of the nonbank players relative to the banks, but point noted. And I guess, just on a separate question there, Jeremy. We didn't see any build in the CET1 when I look at the numerator. Anything going on there this quarter that impacted it? And with the stock where it is at 2.4 times tangible book, just you remind us of how important are buybacks here as opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I mean, the answer to how important buybacks are is that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy, as we often say, right? So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividend and only then do we look at buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in, where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan anymore and if we just simply have to comply with the minimums and BAU, that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness, which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon. So nothing really going on this quarter other than a little bit of RWA growth in the denominator.




 And we're just really going to stay nimble there.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst But is there a case to be made, Jeremy, in terms of just holding some dry powder and excess capital given your macro outlook as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah. I think the valuations -- as the stock goes up, you're going to -- you should expect us maybe one day, buy less. And we don't need dry powder. We have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity, I mean, extraordinary. And we earned $40 billion pre-tax a year. I mean how much dry powder do you need? We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable securities. We have 200 -- well over $200 million of equity. We can issue preferreds, we can issue debt. We can issue stock, if we had to do something. So I don't think we need dry powder. I think our capital cup runneth over where it is.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Noted. Thank you.OperatorThe next one is from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Good morning. So Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category. Just looking ahead, is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth or is there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration in lending activity, whether it's just greater pent-up loan demand, normalization of the card payment rates or something else?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for 2022, which I'm not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a high level. I mean we've talked a lot about spend, which we believe in, driving card loans higher. So that's one piece. And the revolve story within that, as a function of the spend down in cash buffers, especially in our revolver -- the revolving segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well, if you kind of think about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings in the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately card that drives things. In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system, in a world where even if tapering starts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly eight months at $15 billion of decrease a month, you still -- if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE.




 So we are dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity. And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a minimum. But frankly, that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps, but it's a good question.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst No. Thanks, Jeremy. It absolutely helps. And just one clarifying question on the FICC commentary. You noted this quarter's result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. I'm assuming you could help unpack what that adjustment actually entails? What prompted it? And could you help size the impact in the quarter?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes, which we don't really have. It's just bog-standard liquidity evaluation-type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of -- as we revise our assumptions about what the potential transaction cost would be associated with transferring certain types of positions. It's normal-course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger. I think fixed income was down 20%. And I think without that, it would have been down 15%, so hope that helps.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




 Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorNext question is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 Hey, guys. I was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity. And I guess just to kind of lean in a little bit. If we look at the growth in deposits -- and I know some of them are kind of considered noncore. But take out the loan growth and the growth in the securities book since COVID, you've got about an extra $500 billion of deposits. And how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities? And understanding that you expect loan growth to pick up, so that will go to some. But is there a way to size that $500 billion capacity in terms of bond securities?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is in any given moment. Obviously, as you said, loan growth. But also we will always make these decisions on a long-term economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII.




 And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns and, frankly, whether or not you see value. And that, if anything, is probably the biggest single factor right now, as I talked about earlier. It is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate perspective and that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now. But when you start talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in and the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed. And there's just not a lot of value there. So we're always -- we always try to be long-term, economically motivated there considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet and looking at value and being tactical there. So that's really how I would think about that.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yup. I mean I understood on the near-term basis. But I think a lot of investors are sitting here saying, if the 10-year or really any part of the curve hits that magic point for you, what is just the capacity? So for example, if the 10-year gets to say 3% and you're confident it's not going to go to 5%, do you have $100 billion of capacity? Is it $300 billion? Just any way to frame it longer term, appreciating that it's not what you're looking to do at this moment at these levels?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I get the question and ...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We can easily do $200 billion.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean I get the question. I get why you want to know. I guess I just feel -- think like for a company of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target at which we would deploy a particular amount, of course, Jamie's right. But it's always going to be situational. It's always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is. I mean in your question, you alluded to it. It's like if the 10-year notes are at 3% and we're sure it's not going to 5%, but then where is the rest of the yield curve? What are the other options? What's going on in that moment? So it's -- there's -- we're always going to be situational and tactical about it.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 That's helpful. And then can I just squeeze in? You've announced a bunch of kind of what most of us would characterize as relatively small acquisitions, some this quarter and, obviously, looking back for the full year. Is there something -- is there a way you can kind of size the capital impact of that? I know most of the terms weren't disclosed individually. But any way to frame kind of the capital and financial impact? And then just lastly, remind us like what is the driving force when you look for a deal? Because some of the deals you kind of look at and you're like, how does that fit into broader J.P. Morgan Chase? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, I think it's ...




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The capital impact in total isn't that big a deal. No, we're not going to disclose any more, nor is the immediate financial impact. And each one is different. So in consumer, Jeremy already said, it's more about lifestyle, travel, lounges, millennial, stuff like that. In asset management, it's products. There was tax-efficient products, ESG products, timber products, stuff like that. And then between nutmeg and C6 and stuff like that, that is the longer-term view about us trying to get positioned into retail overseas over 10 years if we can.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 Great. Thank you.OperatorNext one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital markets. Please proceed.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Thank you. Good morning. Jeremy, you were saying that when we were talking earlier about the potential SLR changes and such and we haven't seen anything in Quarles' leaving today. But you mentioned about maybe the Fed is focused on the Basel III endgame that's coming very soon here. Can you share with us, from your guys' perspective, what are you focusing in on with the Basel III final rules and regulations that could affect your growth going forward?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think, I mean, the thing about the Basel III endgame is that you need to essentially deal simultaneously with the Basel floors, the Basel standardized floors and the Collins floor. So you need to simultaneously -- so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough challenge to simultaneously put in place a U.S. rule, which is Basel compliant, while also complying with the Collins floor standardized RWA minimum.




 And so that's complicated and it's hard and it's quite technical. And that sort of explains why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have otherwise thought. In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean, at a high level, it's unlikely to be significant. I think that the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to these sort of non-risk-sensitive size-based constraints, like G-SIB and SLR, where obviously, most prominently in the case of G-SIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was and to a very significant degree, are driven by the expansion of the system that we've seen in the last 18 months. So that's why we believe that, that should be addressed as was contemplated in the original rule. And so across all of those potential changes, you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to those. You can imagine that Basel III endgame in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others, a little bit less capital efficient at the margin. But we're a big, diversified company. We're pretty good at navigating this stuff. So when we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Very good. Thank you. And then obviously, you and the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year-over-year basis. I think your deposits are up 20% all in. You talked specifically about retail being the No. 1 market share in retail deposits. When the Fed ends QE, assuming it does sometime by the middle of next year -- and I'm not asking you guys to forecast where your deposits are going to be. But just higher level, should we anticipate that deposits could actually decline or no, that they are going to be so sticky, even with the liquidity that everybody carries, that we shouldn't really see a decline in deposits after QE ends, so let's call it, second half of next year?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think there's a couple of factors in here. So let's, for the sake of argument, set RRP aside for a second and hold that constant. If you just look at the impact of QE on systemwide deposits -- we talk about tapering, but as I said earlier, tapering still involves another $0.5 trillion of system expansion between now and the end of tapering or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.




 If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. And again, setting RRP aside for a second, it would only really be with the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking. And I think the timing last time, if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. Now of course, RRP could bounce around and there could be other factors. But at a high level, that's how we're thinking about it.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I -- I would just add my two cents. I think they'll have to go quicker than that and they'll have to reverse some of it. So you're talking about -- we're still going to increase deposits for a year and then there'll be a fairly large reduction over a two or three year period, which we should be prepared for.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorNext question is from Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. Please proceed.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Good morning. I wanted to sort of get a progress report on your new headquarter building. Specifically, what's the move-in -- projected move-in date or has that been affected by the pandemic? Secondly, are there costs -- noticeable costs running through 2021 expense structure for that build out? And does that tick up noticeably when you move in? And then thirdly, what's the plan for unloading the properties that you'll be vacating? And how is that being affected by the current real estate market? Thank you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the plan is on schedule, move-in date, 20 -- I think 2025. There are no material expense. Of course, there's duplicate expenses and we have to sell the building and stuff like that.




 But there's nothing material to our shareholders we need to disclose. Operator, any other questions?OperatorYes, sir. That is coming from Andrew Lim from Societe Generale. Please proceed.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst




 Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And so you talked, Jamie, about how you're focusing on inflation. Just wondering if you could outline what you're looking at exactly metric-wise across your businesses to signal to you that inflation is actually materializing as a concern. And how would that pan out versus your expectations? And in terms of like how we deal with it, so if it does materialize as a concern, is there anything that you can do to try and protect the bank against inflationary forces there?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Well, I mean I think we should look at the big picture here, which I think it's always important. I mean two years ago, we were facing COVID, verging a great depression, global pandemic. And that's all in the back mirror, which is good.




 So by, hopefully, a year from now, there will be no supply chain problem. The pandemic will become endemic. And I think it's very good to have good, healthy growth, which we have. And I think it's -- be good to have unemployment at 4%. It's good that their jobs are open. I think it's going to waste window? And I think there's too much focus on -- and none of this changes how we run the business. Which we add clients all the time, consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small business, large companies and stuff like that, which is really the underlying thing that drives J.P. Morgan. It's not whether they take the revolver from 25% or 27%. So having said all of that, yes and I'm not focused on inflation. We simply are pointing out, well, first of all, you have inflation. It's 4%. It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters. And in my view, unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that. The only question is, does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages, more people looking for work or does it continue to go up? And of course, we prepare for probabilities and eventualities. And one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think, that they'll have to tamp down.




 I doubt that will happen before late 2022. In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this thing and have 4% unemployment. And you can have good growth with some inflation and that's OK. I think the people are always focusing too much on immediate concerns. If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit accounts and checking accounts and grow our business. I also should point out because this is always in the back of my mind, of our $30 billion of revenues, $20 billion is subscription revenues, asset management, commercial banking, consumer banking which is pretty good, wholesale payments, security services, custody. And so we're pretty proud with the people who accomplished all this. If you look at the actual underlying numbers we're getting earnings per second, more customers, more accounts, more share. And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst




 OK. That's great. So it seems like you're taking a benign view that it's a manageable -- it's not going to get out of hand.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No. No. It's the opposite. I'm telling you I don't -- no, it's the opposite. I'm telling you, I don't know. We're prepared for all eventualities. There may be a fat tail of inflation. And one of the things about our balance sheet -- you guys talked about liquidity and stuff like that.




 One of the fat tails a bank should be -- the banks should be worried about is high inflation and high rates. And have -- being very liquid protects us more against that than other things.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Right. Got it. Thanks for the clarity on that. And just a short follow-on question really. Could you update us on the amount of excess provisions you've got versus your base case economic scenario? You've given that number in the past. And perhaps a bit of color also on how that base case has changed over the quarter, if it has indeed.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think the base case, the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter on quarter in light of the revisions in GDP outlook. But as you know, the framework also involves looking at probability-weighted scenarios. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the sort of less extreme downside scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter. In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the COVID-related unusual features, i.e., uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now, or uncertainty about labor market conditions or the fact that even though a lot of the -- essentially all the federal-level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have, too, there's still some forms of assistance. The mortgage foreclosure moratoriums, student loan stuff, rent moratoria, stuff like that, that don't roll off until later in the year. So there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual, which do contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have. And as things play out, those will develop.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Jeremy, just to interrupt real quickly. I got to go because I'm out of town. I have meetings I have to go to, but you guys should continue. And folks, thanks for listening to us and we'll talk to you all soon.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer All right. Thanks, Jamie.Operator




And by that, we have no further questions waiting.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thanks very much.Operator

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q2 2021 Earnings CallJul 13, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second-quarter 2021 earnings call. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. Before we get going, I'd just like to say how honored I am to be on my first earnings call following the footsteps of Marianne and Jen, both of whom taught me so much during my time working for them, and whose shoes will be very difficult to fill but I'm going to try. So with that, this presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $11.9 billion, EPS of $3.78 on revenue of $31.4 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23%. These results include $3 billion of credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Touching on a few highlights. Combined debit and credit spend was up 45% year on year and more importantly, up 22% versus the more normal pre-COVID second quarter of 2019.It was an all-time record for IB fees, up 25% year on year, driven by advisory and debt underwriting. We saw particularly strong growth in AWM, with record long-term flows as well as record revenue. And finally, credit continues to be quite healthy, as evidenced by our exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. Regarding our balance sheet, the trends from recent quarters have largely continued. Deposits are up 23% year on year and 4% sequentially, and loan growth remains low, flat year on year and up 1% quarter on quarter, although we have bright spots in certain pockets and the consumer spend trends are encouraging. So now turning to Page 2 for more detail. As I go through this page, I'm going to provide you some context about the prior-year quarter because the year on year comparisons are a bit noisy. So with respect to revenue, the second quarter of 2020 was an all-time record for markets, with revenue of over $9.7 billion, and we recorded approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book.




 With that in mind, revenue of $31.4 billion was down $2.4 billion or 7% year on year. Non-interest revenue was down $1.3 billion or 7% due to the prior-year items I just mentioned, partially offset by strong fee generation in investment banking and AWM as well as from card-related fees on higher spend. And net interest income was down $1.1 billion or 8%, driven by lower markets NII and lower balances in card. Expenses of $17.7 billion were up 4% year on year, largely on continued investments. And then on credit costs, going back to last year again, you will recall, in last year's second quarter, we built $8.9 billion in credit reserves during the height of the pandemic, whereas this year, we released $3 billion. So in this quarter, credit costs were a net benefit of $2.3 billion. And setting aside the reserve release, it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $700 million were half of last year's second-quarter number and continue to trend near historical lows. On the next page, let's go over the reserves. We released $3 billion this quarter as we grow increasingly confident about the economy in light of continued improvement in COVID, especially in the U.S. In consumer, we released $2.6 billion, including $1.8 billion in card and $600 million in home lending. And in Wholesale, we released nearly $450 million. So this leaves us with reserves of $22.6 billion, which, as a result of elevated remaining uncertainty about COVID and the shape of the economic recovery, are higher than would otherwise be implied by our central economic forecasts. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, down slightly versus the prior quarter, as net growth in retained earnings was more than offset by higher RWA across both retail and wholesale lending. This quarter also reflects the expiration of the temporary SLR exclusions and, as we anticipated, leverage is now a binding constraint. As you know, we finished CCAR a couple of weeks ago, and our SCB will be 3.2%, which reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the third quarter.




 OK. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 5. CCB reported net income of $5.6 billion, including reserve releases of $2.6 billion on revenue of $12.8 billion, up 3% year on year. Of particular note this quarter is the acceleration of card spend. And so while card outstandings remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, this quarter's trends make us optimistic. Total debit and credit spend was up 45% year on year, and more importantly, up 22% versus the second quarter of '19. And within that, compared to 2019, June total spend was up 24%, indicating some healthy acceleration throughout the quarter. And travel and entertainment has really turned the corner, with spend flat versus the second quarter of '19, accelerating from down 11% in April to actually up 13% in June. The rest of the CCB story remains consistent with prior quarters. consumer and Small Business cash balances remain elevated, resulting in depressed loan growth. Overall loans were down 3% year on year from continued elevated prepayments in mortgage and on lower card outstandings, partially offset by strong growth in auto and the impact of PPP. Home lending and auto continued to have strong originations, with home lending up 64% to $40 billion, the highest quarterly figure since the third quarter of 2013 and auto up 61% to a record $12.4 billion. Deposits were up 25% year on year or approximately $200 billion, and client investment assets were up 36% driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. And our omnichannel strategy continues to deliver. We are more than halfway through our initial market expansion commitment as we have opened more than 200 new branches out of our goal of 400, which have exceeded our expectations by generating $7 billion in deposits and investments. And we are planning to be in all 48 contiguous states by the end of the summer.




 Digital trends continue to be strong as retail mobility recovers at a faster pace than branch transactions, which are still down more than 20% versus 2019. Active mobile users grew 10% year on year to over 42 million, and total digital transactions per engaged customer were up 12%. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 4% year on year, driven by continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Looking forward, the obvious question is the outlook for loan growth, especially in card. And we are quite optimistic that the current spend trends will convert into resumption of loan growth through the end of this year and into next. And while we wait, the exceptionally low level of net charge-offs provides a substantial offset to the NII headwind. Next, the corporate and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5 billion and an ROE of 23% on revenue of $13.2 billion. IB fees of $3.6 billion were up 25% year on year and up 20% quarter on quarter an all-time record driven by advisory and debt underwriting, leading to a year-to-date global IB wallet share of 9.4% and a No. 1 ranking. In advisory, we were up 52% year on year, benefiting from the surge in announcement activity that has continued into the second quarter. Debt underwriting fees were up 26%, driven by an active acquisition finance market, offset by lower investment-grade issuance. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 9%, primarily driven by a strong performance in IPOs. The resulting investment banking revenue of $3.4 billion was roughly flat year on year due to the headwinds of the prior-year's markup in the bridge book. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the pipeline remains very strong. We expect M&A activity and the IPO markets to remain active.




 And while IBCs are likely to be down sequentially, we still expect them to be up year on year. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $6.8 billion, down 30% compared to an all-time record quarter last year. While normalization has been more prevalent in macro, overall, we ran above 2019 levels throughout the quarter on the back of strong client activity, outperforming our own expectations from earlier in the year. Fixed income was down 44% compared to last year's exceptional results, but up 11% compared to the second quarter of '19. Equity markets was up 13%, driven by record balances in prime as well as strong performance in cash and equity derivatives, where we matched last year's great results. Looking forward, while we expect normalization to continue across both investment banking and markets, and most notably in Fixed Income, the timing and the extent of the normalization is obviously hard to predict. Wholesale payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5%, driven by higher deposits and fees, largely offset by deposit margin compression. And Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%, as deposit margin compression was predominantly offset by growth in deposits and fees. Expenses of $6.5 billion were down 4% year on year, driven by lower performance-related compensation, partially offset by higher volume-related expense. Moving to commercial banking on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of $1.4 billion and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 3% year on year, with higher investment banking, lending and wholesale payments revenue, largely offset by lower deposit revenue and the absence of a prior-year equity investment gain. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.2 billion was up 37% on increased M&A and acquisition-related financing activity compared to prior-year lows. Expenses of $981 million were up 10% year on year, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses and investments. Deposits of $290 billion were up 22% year on year as client balances remain elevated.




 Loans of $2.5 billion were down 12% year on year, driven by lower revolver utilization compared to the prior-year quarter, and down 1% sequentially. C&I loans were down 1% quarter on quarter, with lower utilization partially offset by new loan activity in Middle Market. And CRE loans were down 1%, but we saw pockets of growth in affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $377 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of only 1 basis point. And to complete our lines of business, on to asset and wealth management on Page 8. Asset and wealth management's reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pre-tax margin of 37% and an ROE of 32%. Record revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year on year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit 1margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 11% year on year, driven by higher performance-related compensation and distribution expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $49 billion continued to be positive across all channels, with notable strength in equities, fixed income and alternatives. AUM was $3 trillion. And for the first time, overall client assets were over $4 trillion, up 21% and 25% year on year, respectively, driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 21% year on year with continued strength in securities-based lending, custom lending and mortgages, while deposits were up 37%. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.2 billion. Revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, down $415 million year on year. NII was down $274 million, primarily unlimited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued, and we realized $155 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter.




 Expenses of $515 million were up $368 million year on year. So with that, on Page 10, the outlook. Our 2021 NII outlook of around $52.5 billion remains in line with the updated guidance we provided last month. But as you'll note, we've also lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to less than 250 basis points, which, as I mentioned in CCB, provides a meaningful offset to the NII headwind. And it's worth mentioning that the current environment makes forecasting NII even in the near term unusually challenging. So while $52.5 billion remains our current central case, you should expect some elevated uncertainty around that number, not only because of the ongoing impact of stimulus on consumer balance sheets, but also due to volatility coming from markets, among other things. And as a reminder, most of any fluctuation in markets NII, whether up or down, is likely to be offset in NIR. On expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $71 billion, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses. So to wrap up, we are encouraged by the continued progress against the virus and the economic recovery that is underway, especially in the United States, although we want to acknowledge the challenges that much of the rest of the world is facing, and we're hopeful that a global recovery will follow closely behind. Our performance this quarter once again showcases the power of our diversified business model as headwinds in NII from consumer delevering are offset by strong fee generation across AWM and CIB and exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. While we're proud of the performance of the company and of our people through the crisis, the competition in every business from banks, fintechs and others is as intense as ever. So as we look forward to an increasingly normal environment, we are enthusiastically focused on competing for every piece of share in every market, product and business where we operate and making the necessary investments to win. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. 




 Questions & Answers: OperatorAnd our first question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Glenn.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi, there. Hi, Jeremy, welcome. Welcome to the party.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you very much.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Question on NII, if I could and apologize if it's a little multifaceted. But so even though we're getting some inflationary data, and you're possibly inclined on economy, as it might, rates fell. I'm not sure you want to opine on why, but let's talk about you kept the NII guide I'm assuming because deposit growth is strong. Curious, your thoughts on consumer payment rates staying at this elevated level, deposit growth staying at this elevated level? And then, most importantly, if you're managing the balance sheet any differently, meaning you had been slow playing, putting money to work, rates are even lower now, but are you still slow playing putting money to work? I appreciate it. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. All right. So let's sort of take that in parts. So in terms of our NII guidance, so yeah, so we're reiterating $52.5 billion for the full year. So just to take your deployment point first, obviously, rates are a little bit lower, long end rates are a bit lower. The curve has flattened a little bit since we provided that guidance. But when we provided that guidance, we were reasonably conservative in our deployment assumptions through the rest of the year. So as a result of that, it's not really a meaningful factor, sort of at the level of precision that we're talking about here. In terms of the consumer side, as you say, obviously, it's really -- card is really going to be the big driver. So you heard us talking about payment rates, and you see the sequential growth in card loans. So we do believe that the sort of acceleration and the pickup in spend is going to translate to, as I say, a resumption of loan growth in card. But we do think that pay rates are going to remain quite elevated at a minimum through the end of this year. So as a result, we don't really see revolving interest-bearing balances increasing meaningfully this year. And so as a result, that remains a headwind for the overall NII for this year, which is incorporated in the outlook.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. And then in terms of managing balance sheet any differently in terms of putting money to work, are you still conservative on that front?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Look, I mean, I think you've heard us talk about this before, right? So our central case, from an economic perspective, is for a very robust recovery. And that's pretty much a consensus view between us, our research team, the Fed, etc. And that view is associated with higher inflation, along the lines of the Fed's own targets for higher inflation.




 All those things together, it's an outlook that's associated with higher rates, all else equal. And so in light of all that, we do remain happy to stay patient here. And if you look at our EIR disclosure, which you obviously won't see until you get the Q, but some of you guys have written about this recently, our overall sensitivities here are kind of in line with the industry. So when you consider kind of the tail-type things that Jamie also talks about, the complexity of the balance sheet and various other factors, we do still feel that being patient here makes sense.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. And just one quickie on the recent both acquisitions and investments, and you or Jamie could feel free to take it, I'm curious on, a, big picture, is it just coincidence that there's been five things within a very short period of time? And maybe if you want to expand on maybe net mix, specifically, and why the change in terms of shying away from international expansion in the past and now making a little bit better move in? I appreciate it. Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure, Glenn. So let me start with the international expansion point on the consumer side because that's interesting. You've heard Jamie over the years talk about why it wouldn't really make sense to do international expansion in consumer when you think about that through the lens of a branch-based strategy. So if you imagine, going outside of the U.S. and opening branches in other countries and competing with the incumbents, just from a branding perspective, from an operating leverage perspective, we've never felt that, that was likely to be a successful strategy for us, and that hasn't really changed. The difference right now is the ability to do that digital. So what's really particularly exciting about the international expansion narrative, both in the U.K. and now with our recent investment in C6 in Brazil, is the ability to kind of experiment a little bit. Obviously, it's a strategically compelling opportunity. Brazil, as you probably know, is like the third biggest consumer Banking market in the world. But it's kind of fun to be the disruptor. And so I think, for us, given our position in consumer Banking in the United States, being in a place where we are actually the outsider disrupting through these kind of digital channels, we see it, among other things, in addition to being compelling financially, as a really good opportunity to learn and to challenge ourselves a little bit from the inside. So we're quite excited about that stuff.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst All right. Thanks very much.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Glenn.




OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I want to ask you about capital. You mentioned leverage is now the binding constraint.




 And Jen has previously talked about a 12% CET1 target. I guess, could you talk about the multiple variables that you're balancing as you guys decide what capital levels to run at? You've got a rising GSIB score, an SLR cushion that's shrinking, but maybe the rules get revised. And obviously, an SCB, that came down a little bit, but maybe you're hoping for more. How are you wrapping that all together into what kind of capital levels to target?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It's a good question, John and yeah, there are a lot of variables. So let me start by saying that, in terms of a 12% target, it's not off the table, is what I'll say about that, meaning 12% -- it's not necessarily -- doesn't necessarily need to be higher. So for now, it's not off the table. But the element of time, i.e., when are we bound by what, matters quite a bit as you think about this. So just to go through some of the pieces. You've noted the GSIB point. So we're in the 4% bucket now as of the end of last year.




 That comes into play in 2023. We're currently operating in four and a half. As you know, that's quite a seasonal number. So it's still possible to get under four and a half for the end of this year. But we have to acknowledge an elevated probability, I would say, of landing in the four and a half bucket this year. But the four and a half bucket would be binding in 2024. And as you noted, in the meantime, we're bound by SLR. And we've been quite public about our views about these things, about the extent to which, increasingly, our capital requirements are driven by nonrisk-sensitive, size-based measures which were really designed, especially in the case of SLR, as backstops, which the Fed has acknowledged. So our priority, right -- and the Fed has talked about potentially addressing some of these things. We know we're waiting for an NPR on SLR, but also, they have said that a potential GSIB fix could come as part of the holistic implementation of the Basel III end game. So there's a lot of things that are going to play out between now and some of those minimums becoming binding. And realistically, right now, we're going to be operating above 12% anyway in light of the leverage bound in all likelihood. So we're managing a variety of different factors, near term, short term, prefs, common, etc. And we're just going to try to be nimble about it as more information comes out over the next few quarters.




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And John, if I could just make a further point. We have tons of capital, $200 billion of CET1, $35 billion of preferred, $300 million of long-term debt, only $1 trillion of loans, which is the riskiest asset we have, and $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities. So the underlying thing is there's just tons of capital in the system. And I think, one day, if you have a look at it and say, why so much to the liquid side.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Yeah. And then a quick follow-up, Jeremy, on expenses. You revised the fiscal year '21 outlook upward a few times now. Could you give a little more detail on the business volumes and revenues that are driving this? And also, we hear a lot about inflation across the economy.




 Are we seeing broader inflation play a role in your company's expenses and outlook?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a couple of things there. So yeah, as you note, we have revised up from $70 billion to $71 billion, and the biggest single driver there is volume and revenue-related expense where if -- which is comp. Well, it's comp, but it's about to.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 The comp, we're going to be competitive in comp, no matter what it takes. Let's just keep that in the back of your mind.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer It is a little bit of comp. It's also transaction-related volumes. It's also marketing expense in certain pockets. So it's all the stuff that fits in the category of volume and revenue-related. And I think the point is, obviously, we're all a little bit focused on the NII headwinds right now. But from an AR perspective, across markets, AWM, IB, CIB in general, and even pockets, wealth management and CCB, we're actually outperforming the revenue expectations that were built into our prior expense guidance. So that's kind of the dynamic there. In terms of inflation, I would say that we're not seeing inflation in our actuals.




 But obviously, your guess is as good as mine in terms of the future, but it would be reasonable to assume that, that's going to be a little bit of a challenge, to a greater or lesser degree, if the economy as a whole is in a slightly higher inflationary environment. And we did probably include a little bit of that expectation in the $71 billion for this year.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Got it. Thanks.Operator




Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, if I could just follow-up on your points about capital and just how we should be thinking about -- you gave us clarity on the dividend, and we know there's the $30 billion open authorization on the buyback. Again, just kind of fitting for the middle there, how do you balance just the magnitude of buyback you do from here versus the ongoing growth that we have in the balance sheet vis-à-vis what you just talked about as far as the limitations? Thanks.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So I mean the answer to how we balance it is we talk about it a lot. We have a lot of smart people looking at it, trying to balance all the different constraints that we're managing. And I think Jen talked before, especially when it comes to the balance between our risk-based minimums and the SLR constraint, which, as you know, we can address with prefs, so about kind of the mixture of prefs and common. So we're looking at that. I think RRP is helping a little bit on the deposit growth side, which helps a little bit with the management of SLR. But as I said previously, we're going to stay nimble there and use the tools at our disposal to try to strike the right balance between buybacks and pref issuance, recognizing that overissuing prefs potentially locks us in to high-cost prefs with low flexibility because of the five-year lockout. So there's a lot of balancing there and we're just staying nimble as information potentially trickles out on the evolution of the rules.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. And then just so -- then, as far as how you guys will communicate, we'll just find out about the buyback on a quarterly basis as opposed to you giving a more broad outlook of your expectations around buybacks as it happened more in the past. Is that fair?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I think that's right, especially in the new environment that we're operating in from a buyback perspective, now that it's not sort of an approved plan through CCAR, but is rather just the overall $30 billion board authorization. Given what I just talked about in terms of the need to stay nimble across multiple constraints, we wouldn't want to box ourselves in by speaking publicly ahead of time in terms of what we're going to do. So -- and you know obviously our normal capital higher, so at the end of the day, we're always going to invest first and look at interesting acquisitions and pay a sustainable dividend. And at the end of that, we'll look at buybacks in the context of all the other factors.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. We could probably give you a more definitive thing after they finish Basel III, which is now 10 years in the making, and SLR and all the updates, and then you'll have more certainty about how this thing operates going forward.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, John. I mean, Ken, sorry.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the card business. You had 7% quarter-over-quarter growth in balances, but I think your guidance was still a little cautious. Is that just being conservative? You're still not sure about the relationship between spend and balance growth? Or how do we think about the good quarter and sort of that cautious outlook?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I wouldn't use the word conservative. We've tried very hard in our outlook to give you central case numbers. So we're going to be wrong, but hopefully, it will be wrong symmetrically. So we really want to try hard to give you central case numbers that don't have baseless optimism or unnecessary conservatism in them. What -- so the point that you highlight, the sort of apparent disconnect between the sequential increase in card loans and the relatively muted NII outlook is really just about pay rates. So we continue to see very elevated pay rates by historical standards really highly unusual as a result of some of the themes that we've called out in terms of the strength of the consumer balance sheet. So as long as that's true, and we're seeing sort of unusually low conversion of spend into revolving balances, that's going to be a little bit of an NII headwind until the consumer starts to relever which we do think will happen.




 We just don't think it's likely to be a meaningful effect this year.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst That's fair. And then on the charge-offs, that's obviously been a big benefit. I think if we look at delinquencies, both early stage and later stage, they kept falling throughout the quarter. Is there anything unusual this quarter where we saw a pretty big drop? Should we expect further declines in NCOs as the year progresses, given delinquency trends?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So I think on charge-offs, I would just stick to the updated card guidance that we gave, which is lower, just saying that's going to be below two and a half. But again, it's the same themes, right? Like elevated cash buffers in consumers are resulting in exceptionally strong NCO performance and sort of upside surprises in terms of people paying. So there's sort of two sides of the same coin right now, lower revolving balances, better NCOs. And then as we continue returning to normal, presumably in 2022, we should see both of those come back slightly to historical trends.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst All right. Fair enough. Thanks.




OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey. Jeremy, welcome. My question, I want to follow-up. I think Glenn asked Jamie for the answer to this question, so I'm going to try again.




 Are these acquisitions that you've done, and I count eight since December, and the question is, Jamie, what is the strategy? Is the strategy, I guess, in some cases, it's to disrupt to new markets, as Jeremy said? Maybe it's to avoid costs, maybe it's to scale across tens of millions of customers or -- and this is the real question, are you looking to connect some of these acquisitions like Nutmeg with -- I can't remember, these Kraft Analytics, Max Techs, C6 Bank, OpenInvest, 55ip. Is the goal to somehow one plus one plus one to equal more than three as you introduce these acquisitions, these companies, these people to each other to create kind of like a 21st century digital banking storefront? Or is that too much of a reach? What's the grand plan here?Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer A little bit too much of a read, but there's very smart analysts who said it's a string of pearls, and I put in that category. So asset management, Campbell is just managing lumber assets. Timber assets is going to be a great thing for Asset Management. 55ip, it's a tax-efficient management to it there. Obviously, Nutmeg, and we're already doing it in the U.K., will be linked together, offering consumer digital product, both in deposits, small business, eventually lending and investments, global investing, etc., makes sense. C6 is another one. Jeremy said it's a huge market. So we're looking at anything which has adjacencies, it could be data, it could be management.




 A lot of these are going to fill in, and some are a little bit more of a response for us. So how we look at retail, digital overseas, we've got patience and time. And we're going to spend a lot of time to see if we can build something very different than we have in the United States. And so it's a little bit of everything. The cxLoyalty or the travel company, again, if you look at that, we are already so large in the travel business. So think of this as enhanced services and our products and capabilities to work with our clients, travel packages, etc., which we already -- I've got to remember, the seventh largest travel company in the United States. And that doesn't include all the travel that goes across our credit card and debit card that's traveled, but we are going to travel -- effectively the travel agent. And so it's a little bit of all that. I'm thrilled we're doing it. We're looking all the time. We're not going to end up with a lot of wasted assets. But some of these things may not work well, but that will be OK.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Mike, the only thing I would add is, there's a couple of themes that you need to come through, some of the things that we've done recently, one of them is ESG. You see that especially in the AWM deals. And the other is just improving the customer experience, whether it's through various fintech deals or cxLoyalty, customer experience is a key priority for us. And we want to have all the tools necessary to deliver that.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And equally important, we're putting a lot of money into building. And we have, like every quarter, through the next two years, you're going to have new products and new services being rolled out across the company. They just -- I think they're just exciting and very good, more and more integrated, more and more simple to use, more and more customer friendly, etc. And so -- but we're doing a little bit of all of that.




 And we want -- yeah, sorry?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Go ahead, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 And I just got -- my follow-up, as you talked about disrupting, I thought that was interesting, disrupting in the U.K. But since you wrote your CEO letter, Jamie, I mean, it's only gotten more competitive from the fintechs and big tech and big retail and everybody else. And that's a question that comes up probably to everyone on this call. Are you going to be disintermediated over the next five years, whether it's -- you know all the companies, but it just seems like they're ramping up that much more. You have an executive order from the White House, maybe you have to share data. What's your current mark-to-market of the threat from outside of banking to your business?Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I don't feel any different thing when I wrote the Chairman's letter. I think we have huge competition in banking and shadow banking, fintech and big tech and Walmart. And obviously, there's always a changing landscape, but we also have a huge -- we've got brands and capability and products and services and market share and profitability.




 I think some of these competitors are going to do quite well. I think a lot of them will succeed over time. But that's called good old American capitalism. I'm quite comfortable we'll do fine. I do think there's going to be a lot of people still in the banking business. I'm talking in about five or 10 or 15 years. I think one day you're going to recall which one who took a shadow bank or, I mean, the banks who will shadow -- will be shadows themselves.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thanks, Jeremy.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. We're working hard to make sure that we're offering services that are not disruptible because they're good. So if our clients are happy, and we're providing them a great experience, then there's nothing to disrupt.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All right. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks, Jamie.




OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess just sticking with the digital strategy. We heard Jamie talk about multiple times around the lack of imagination that cost the banking industry in terms of either payments or buy now pay later, and you talked about your international expansion. But again, going back to Mike's point, as shareholders of banks in the U.S., should the expectation be that banks will be fast followers of what fintech comes up with and replicating that, given the risk of cannibalizing your own sort of revenue set? Or do we expect, or do you think we should expect, more disruptive innovation coming from banks in the United States on consumer banking?




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer I think it's both. I mean, it's not an either/or question. And remember, a lot of these banks have done quite well. Clearly, Bank of America has done quite well in digital products and stuff like that. So when I said the lack of imagination with the whole company, I mean, when you look at some of these things, it was -- we could have imagined more why they've become the competitor down the road. So some of these competitors are quite good at I call it buying and weaving. They start with one little thing. They had product. They have services. They had eyeballs. They had customers, and they find ways to monetize it. So we've got to be a little more forward-looking in how they're looking at the active guys and stuff like that.




 But in our case, there'll be a little bit of everything.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And I would just say the whole like cannibalization and fast following thing, I think we've moved a little bit beyond that. Like there will be times where we have the first idea, and we're eager to lean in and innovate that way. There will be times when someone else has the first idea, and we're eagerly copying it. But the whole -- we don't want to do this thing that makes sense with the customer because we might be cannibalizing our own revenues, that's a recipe to become a shadow of your former self.




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. There is no fun cannibalizing your revenue, just keep that in mind. We will do the right thing when the time comes. And sometimes, we're a day late, a dollar short, but we'll do the right thing. And just if you look at the company, I mean, if you look at -- we talked about SLR, and I mean, I always get you talk about CECL and SLR, but look at the flows across this company. Look at the debit card, the credit card, the trading flows, the market share, the -- that's why I look at much more than what are the ups and downs to the earnings this quarter because of CECL. I don't think that means anything for the future of the company. I mean, our bankers, our traders, our credit card, our debit card, our merchant services, our auto business, our digital, it's -- they're all doing pretty good. I read -- I look at these reports, and my God, the company is doing quite fine. And yes, and we'd like to be a little critical of ourselves. I think when companies aren't, that's part of their failure. They should look at what they didn't do well, I mean, what others may have done well, and so I'd be prepared.




 And we have a really fair assessment of the competition. It is very large, and it's going to be very tough. It does not mean that JPMorgan will win, it just means our eyes are open.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst No and I agree. And I think banks don't do -- talk enough about client acquisitions and market share. So I agree with you there. Just as a follow-up, Jamie, very quickly. There's some questions around like peak inflation, peak growth. I know you guys are very bullish. Compare and contrast how the world looks to you today versus back in 2011 when we came out of the financial crisis and the risk of GDP growth disappointing over the next few years?




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer I think they're completely different fundamentally. Coming out of the '09 crisis, OK, the world was massively overleveraged. We had investment banks at 40 times leverage, not JPMorgan. We did not need PARP and didn't need help. The Lehman, Baird, Goldman, Morgan, you had banks overseas, Dexia, the Landon Banks, but I can't remember half of them, all went bankrupt. You had hedge funds deleveraging, you had companies deleveraging, you had $0.5 trillion to $1 trillion in mortgage losses that were going to be recognized, actual losses spread around balance sheets and derivatives and stuff like that. So the world was in a massive deleveraging mode. The consumers overleveraged, companies overleveraged. The bridge book of Wall Street was $400 billion. Today, it's, I think, $60 billion. So that -- if you look at today, today, everything we talk about loans being down, if the consumer is -- the pump is primed. The consumer, their house value is up, their stocks rise up, their incomes are up, their savings are up, their confidence are up.




 The pandemic is kind of in the rearview mirror. Hopefully, nothing gets worse with it. And they're raring to go. And you see it in home prices, you see it in auto purchases. You see it -- I mean, they'd be much higher, but for supply constraints right now. And so -- and businesses equally are in good shape. They're not overleveraged today. They do have a lot of charts show that corporate debt is like higher than it was, but so is corporate cash. And if you look at middle market losses, it's almost 0, almost 0, a huge unutilized revolving stuff like that. So the second the economy starts to grow, which -- and I mean, as you're going to see loans go up because of inventory receivables and capital expenditures and stuff like that. So it is completely different. And you've got fiscal policy on autopilot. I mean there's a lot that hasn't been spent yet. There's a lot more that's going to be passed. And you have QE, so far, it's a little bit around positive to around $20 million a month. And I just think you're going to see -- hopefully, see a very strong economy.




 We don't know how long. Obviously, if you listened to what I just said, that -- there's a little inflationary effect on that. And we don't know in the future -- I talked about Goldilocks. Goldilocks means -- it's I'm hopeful, not predicting. Like Goldilocks is that inflation goes up, the 10-year bond goes up, the growth is still quite strong. You may have growth in the second half this year as stronger than it's ever been in the United States of America, OK? And Europe is probably six months behind America. And so growth can go into next year, and then the 10-year bond goes to 3% and a lot of growth, the short base grew, too. It won't make any difference because we always had strong growth in consumer there. Jobs are plentiful, wages are going up. These are all good things. And so, yes, obviously, it's the inflation could be worse than people think. I think it will be a little bit worse with the bad things. I don't think it's all going to be temporary, but that doesn't matter if we have very strong growth.




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. There are always risks in any environment, but the risks in this one, I think, are quite different from the ones that we had coming out of the global financial crisis.Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.




OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hey, good morning. 




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Steven.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst So I wanted to just start off with just a follow-up question on card NII. Jeremy, you did strike an optimistic tone on the higher spend trends and the potential for future NII tailwind as payment rates start to normalize. And just looking at the card revenue rate, given there are another of inputs in that metric, I was hoping you could just help us isolate the potential NII benefit versus the current baseline from a normalization in payment rate. So just the payment rate normalizing, what would be the incremental step-up in the quarterly NII run rate?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So there's a lot of pieces in that question, Steven. So first, let's talk about the revenue rate. So a couple of things. So in terms of the NII, we don't really see a meaningful uptick in card NII happening this year. Like you might maybe see a tiny bit of it sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter, but I think it's going to be pretty hard to see. So I think you want to be thinking about that as a 2022 effect. I'm not going to get into guiding on revenue rate for 2022. And I will actually point out that we're in the market right now competing aggressively with some great offers. And I'm happy to say, actually, the client acquisition in card is going great, and we're seeing great uptake on the offers. But that comes with a bit of elevated marketing expense. So as I look out to next quarter, you might actually see a bit of a dip in the revenue rate just because of the way the accounting works there.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst OK. And for my follow-up Jeremy, I just wanted to ask or at least hone in on one comment you made, where you said you could potentially still manage to a 12% capital target. I was just trying to better understand how much capital cushion you are looking to manage to under the SEB? And if the GSIB surcharge is not recalibrated, where do you think you'll have to run on a steady-state basis just because it feels like waiting for Godot, where you haven't seen any changes on the recalibration front, specifically with the GSIB surcharge?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. OK. So basically, that's a question about the management buffer and a question about what we would do in a world where GSIB doesn't get recalibrated. And a world where GSIB doesn't get recalibrated is a world where our capital minimums are quite a bit higher starting in 2023.




 We obviously disagree with that. We don't think it makes any sense at all, given that a big part of the driver of that increase in the amount of capital that we would have, and as Jamie pointed out earlier, both we and the system are really flushed with capital. And the regulators have been pretty clear that there's enough capital in the system right now, and that growth would increase that amount quite a bit for us and for everyone else. So that's a big part of the reason why we've been so vocal for so long about the need to recalibrate that. And I think we see some of our competitors making those points, too, as they start to creep up into higher buckets. And to be fair, the Fed has acknowledged that this is a thing that used to get fixed. It's just that they're kind of busy trying to get the Basel III end game put in place in the U.S. rules, which brings particular complexities in light of the Collins floor.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer I just -- Can I just add to this? So I've always -- like the GSIB calculation is one of the steepest I've ever seen in my whole life. And then we doubled it here. So the European banks have a lot of disadvantages in terms of -- they don't -- they can't calm the regulators, they can't expand across Europe. But one of the advantages, they have pretty much half the GSIB.




 But I just don't think that, in the long run, that's good -- right for America to be doubling in -- what I could consider basing all the potential numbers. So let's just wait to see what all the new rules are, and then we'll answer that question. You don't have to sit there and guess what the what's going to happen.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And I think you see the important point is that, in the near term, we're actually bound by leverage. So that's what we're focused on right now. That's our biggest single thing that we'd like to see fixed because that is affecting the management of the balance sheet right now in ways that we think really don't make sense and eventually result in higher costs that will get passed on into the real economy. Just to touch on your buffer point briefly. When all is said and done and the framework is fully settled, hopefully, we're back to being bound by risk-based constraints. We have a bit more experience with a couple of years of SCB and there's a little bit less rule uncertainty. It would be -- there's an interesting conversation to have about what the right management buffers are for people in a world where we do think it's important.




 And we've made these points to destigmatize the use of buffers. We've made this point in the context, for example, of the money market complex too. We have all these kind of guidelines. And the rules have them as buffers that you're supposedly free to use, but that's not the way everyone treats them. So buffers become minimums, and that adds a brittleness to the system that makes it more procyclical than anyone wants it to be. So down the road, when things are stable, the buffer discussion could become interesting. But right now, it's a somewhat simpler story, and that's really the SLR.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And remember, there's one buffer that you guys -- we don't really talk about, which is $40 billion of pre-tax earnings a year, OK? That's a huge buffer. It's huge. It allows you to change your forward-looking capital if you buy back stock and don't buy back stock. And so we have a lot of levers.




 And whatever happens, we're going to figure out a way to do a great job for shareholders.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Fair point. Thanks so much for taking my questions.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thanks, Steve.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 Good morning. Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 I want to circle back on costs. Obviously, this year, some of it is driven by the stronger-than-expected fees. Some of it is the inflationary pressures you mentioned. Some is, I think, discretionary, as you've pointed out in the past, accelerating some investment spend. But the question is, as we exit this year, when we look back on costs from 2021 and say they're a little bloated because of all those factors? Or is this going to be a good base year to grow off of going forward?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So there's a couple of points in there. There's -- the word -- let's talk about bloated. I mean you've heard Jamie talk about cost before, right? So we go after everything all the time.




 We go after waste. We try very hard to never be loaded and to not waste. That is a constant discipline. It's hard work. We look for it everywhere. So I would like to say that bloated is not a word we would ever use to describe ourselves. And we spent a bunch of time in the bell of this organization, I really don't think that, that's true. And I don't think anything about what we're doing in terms of how money is being spent this year is wasteful. And in fact, as you know, the really big driver of the kind of impact on run rate spend is the investments that we're making, especially investments in technology and customer experience. And then transforming the core efficiency of the company in terms of things like technology, modernization and data centers and so on. So in terms of projecting forward into 2022, I don't want to get into giving 2022 expense guidance here. And I think that you really have to unpack that cost number between the parts of it that are volume and revenue-related and the kind of more run rate, structural and investment costs as we've talked about before. So I think this year is -- it's a little bit tricky to unpack the components from their perspective to project them to mind.




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And if we can find more good money to spend, we're going to spend it. And I told you guys that there's good expense. When we have credit card to spend, we have so much money in marketing, the returns are very good, and they spend it. If we can open hire great bankers, or stuff like that, we're going to spend it. If we can -- where we spend $200 million in new data centers, which have a huge benefit for us down the road, we're going to spend it. We do not manage the company so we could tell analysts what the expense number is going to be. That is just a bad way to run a company. And conversely, a lot of revenue stuff, too. Revenues aren't always good. And we all know how much risk we take in these businesses and stuff like that. So we spend a lot of time in good revenue, bad revenue and good expense and debt expense. And that's what's going to drive the franchise in the next five or 10 years.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Understood. And then separately, as we think about capital allocation kind of longer term, is there a thought to more meaningfully increase the dividend payout? I mean, as you saw at the beginning of the COVID crisis, buybacks were suspended after stocks dropped sharply, banks couldn't repurchase until they roughly doubled. But dividends were maintained. And obviously, your pre-tax earnings power that you alluded to is very strong. It seems like that soft 30% cap is gone, obviously. So just thoughts, it's not going to happen all in maybe one CCAR cycle, but if we do get a multiyear economic recovery, is your thoughts of pushing the dividend higher maybe closer to like a 50% payout?Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 Probably not. I mean, I think, firstly, we wanted the dividend which is sustainable through a bad downturn, and so we really want to do that. And I think this time kind of proves that. It was a very minor thing relative to capital retention. But yes, we want to invest in our future and invest in growing and stuff like that. And if we can't -- and we don't want to raise the dividend so high that it cripples your ability to do other things.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. And the way that flows into just capital buffer sort of makes that point clear, right? So every -- part of the reason that we're at 3.2 instead of 3.1 is the $0.10 increase that the board announced its intention to do. So...




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And if I owned 100% of the company, there would be no dividend.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK, thank you.




OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. Can you guys share with us -- if you take a look at your net interest margin in the quarter, obviously, it came under pressure. And if we assume -- and I know this is a big assumption, but if we assume that rates don't really change from here over the next six to 12 months, the long end stays anchored where it is, at what point does the average yield in your average interest-earning assets start to stabilize or maybe go up because the new business that you're putting on equals or exceeds what's running off in terms of interest rates on the products that are coming off the balance sheet?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good question, Gerard. So I mean, I guess, one way to think about your question is whether we basically think that NIM has hit the bottom in this quarter. And I think we've all learned the lesson that calling the bottom is a very dangerous thing. And I would also point out, and I would direct you to like the last page of our supplement, I'm not going to give you a big speech on Market NII, which is my favorite topic and why that is really a sort of a distraction that we shouldn't look at. Maybe I'll be able to do that next quarter. But we do have that disclosure where we split out total NII and markets NII as well as NIM excluding markets. And the reason I raised that is that, yes, if your overall mental model is not wrong, it's reasonable to think that NIM might stabilize around these levels. But it's noisy, and the market numbers in there, and that's going to add noise. And also, I would say right now, there's an unusual amount of numerator, denominator-type effects. So whatever winds up being proved up the numerator, you also have quite a bit of volatility in the denominator there, which is one of the reasons that we obviously don't manage to that number as you've heard us say before. But your overall frame, it sounds reasonable to me.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, and I may have misheard you, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said that the higher level of noninterest expense, the outlook that is, was really driven by the improved outlook for non-interest income. Can you give us any color on that part of it, the outlook for non-interest income improvement?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Well, it's -- I mean some of it's in naturals, and some of it's in the outlook. But at a high level, the point is simply that, if you look at the mix of revenue across this company, we have some offsetting dynamics right now. We've got NII headwinds from the consumer delevering, as we've discussed. But as you saw in this quarter's CIB and AWM results, we had exceptional performance in banking even though -- and in wealth management.




 And even though markets is down year on year, it's actually up significantly from what we expect from higher expense guidance. So that's kind of how it all comes together. Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst I appreciate it. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 You want some of these expenses to go up because that means that good revenues are going up.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Hi. Thanks, good morning. Hi, Betsy. I had a couple of questions. One was just on thinking through the outlook for NII, like you indicated, $52.5 billion subject to market conditions. Can you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about market conditions? What's the trigger point for being maybe better than expected versus coming down? And I ask in context of -- I noticed your securities book, you shifted a bunch from AFS to HTM. So it feels like, from that, you're waiting more for rates to move up materially before you would lean into that yield curve trade. But maybe you can give us a sense as to what that market conditions comment was referring to and how you're thinking about that?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So let's go through that for a second. So I said I wasn't going to give my big markets NII speech until next quarter, but I can't resist. So if you talk about market conditions, the markets NII component of that NII outlook includes things like the extent to which we have spec pools versus TBA is the extent to which we have futures versus cash and high rate companies like Brazil, the growth in prime brokerage balances. The common theme across all of these is there are situations where you're deploying balance sheet in your markets business to serve clients, and that's profitable a deployment on a spread basis. But there's quite a bit of gross up between the kind of non-derivative piece of it and a derivative or derivative, I'd like a piece of it. Where are the of derivative piece of it doesn't have any NII, and the non-derivative piece of it does. So every unit of that sort of activity that you do creates a significant swing in the NII number, either up or down, with very little impact to the bottom line. Now that's not the entirety of the markets story. There are parts of the markets business where we're actually doing more...Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 The market, not the markets.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer No, I know. But part of the markets spending comment is the market-dependent -- I don't have markets with me, so I'll go to the other point in a second, and I'm almost done with the speech. Anyway, you get the point. So that's one point of fluctuation. But going to your other piece, so the AFS, HTM, and I think your implied question, which is basically what would make us want to deploy more into a higher rate environment. So I will say that the AFS, HTM changes that you've seen are really just primarily about managing capital across the various constraints while preserving the right level of flexibility to do deployment. But given the level of cash balances right now, the AFS, HTM, those have really remain constrained in terms of duration buys. And I think we have enough flexibility in there to do kind of short-end cash deployment tactically as we always do.




 So to get to the punchline, it's kind of what we said before, which is we're bullish on the economy. We believe that, that comes with higher inflation and, therefore, higher rates. And in light of that, we're happy to be patient right now. When that actually changes, and we decided to deploy more, you'll see it in the future.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And giving a simple answer to that, the $52.5 billion, other than the markets business, which goes up or down, if rates go up, you can see our earnings and risk disclosure, we will earn more NII, all things being equal, which, of course, they never are, but all the deal. And in addition to that, we can make decisions to deploy more money for more NII.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 It's interesting versus when you were at our conference, Jamie, it seems like the $52.5 billion is more a function of the curve, given the fact that card did, it looks like better than you had thought at that time in the middle of June based on your comments about spend being up so much. But the...Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer Betsy, let me just -- sorry to interrupt you, but let me just pick up on that point for a second because I think someone else has a similar question. But I would just remind you that we do see that very healthy sequential growth in card loans on the back of spending. But the key issue is the revolve behavior. And so our view on that really hasn't changed, and we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers, which remains kind of the consistent reason in why we have a muted outlook for card NII this year.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally get that.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And I don't want to correct anyone here, but I personally think you'll see it go up by the end of the year, OK? I think we'll be a little conservative on that because of all the spend and stuff like that. But we hate guessing. What I look at much more is how many cars you have? How much spend do you have? How many happy customers do you have? NII will take care of itself.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 And on that front, your card fees were quite good, right? You mentioned that in your press release. Maybe you can give us a sense as to the drivers? Is that new openings? Is that basically what it is? How sustainable is that? Because that was a bit of an upside surprise in this result the card fees?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I mean I think it's just spend, Betsy. I mean looking at -- you can get more color than that. Reggie can follow-up if you want. But at a high level, I think the card spend number is really all about -- I mean, sorry, the card fee number is really all about the spend trends.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. And then just one last, if I can squeeze it in. Your VAR came down significantly. Can you give us a sense as to what's going on there?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean that's just the volatility of last year's prior quarter coming out of the time series, right, if you think about it.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Fair enough. OK, thanks.OperatorOur next question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst I want to ask that NII question a little bit differently. In reiterating your $52.5 billion guidance, you said there was potential for some variation or variability around that number. And I'm trying to understand where the greatest variation could come from. Is it in your loan growth expectations? Because I'm hearing that you really are not expecting much in the way of loan growth. Or is it in the shape of the yield curve because of the Fed's QE actions or words around taper? And talking about the yield curve, could you also talk a little bit about what's more important, the short end of the yield curve between Fed funds in the two year or the long end? And in that conversation, I'd love to talk about the significant amount of liquidity that's about to hit the short end.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 There is a disclosure in the March 31 10-Q, it shows earning risk. If rates go up 100 basis points, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar of $7 billion, if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points. So the $7 billion, some number like 4.5 or 5 is short rates versus long rates. The long rate number is cumulative. I would add every year until you roll over these things at slightly higher rates. That is the number, OK? They are -- obviously, loan growth is loan growth, that's in the plus or minus, but the biggest thing is the interest rates. Jeremy?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer And other variables.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Well, let me give you the variables, Charles, because it's kind of a reasonable question. So I'll spare you my markets NII speech. You heard it already, but that's obviously a big factor. Within card, we are somewhat optimistic about loan growth, but just remember that, that loan growth has to translate into revolve to drive NII. And so if pay rates remain, as I said earlier, it's the central case forecast that reflects the recent experience. So we are forecasting elevated pay rates. But of course, we could be wrong. They could be even more elevated than we are currently forecasting. So that would be downside. And the opposite of that, if we see the consumer relevering, starting a little bit sooner, would create upside there. And then there's the impact of deployment. So we're staying patient right now, that means that we're not earning the steepness of the yield curve. And if that changes, that could create a little bit of upside. And then there's always the tactical actions that we can take in the front end of the curve. Right now, those aren't very interesting because IOER is above money market rates, which is a big part of the reason that you see RRP having so much uptake. But it's not going to change, and there were opportunities and repo and so on, then that could help a little bit as part of our constant tactical deployment there.




 But that's not, again, our simple case.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Just to follow-up on that. I mean the liquidity that's going to hit in July and August is substantial. And that's going to have some impact on the shape of the yield curve at the short end. We saw a rise in the overnight repo rate, reverse repo rate in June. Is it possible that we have to have another one to keep rates from falling too far?




Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I mean, I think that's a question for kind of short-term fixed income market strategists and my old research team. But right now, it seems like the Fed is pretty committed to making sure that repo rates don't trade negative. That's part of the reason they made the technical correction. That's part of the reason RRP is paying what it pays. So we'll see what happens there. But to me, the front end of the yield curve, from a deployment opportunity perspective, looks not very interesting right now. And that is kind of our central case for the rest of this year.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst




 And did the rise in the RRP rate have any -- your comments about market-driven NII, did it have any impact on market-driven NII?Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's not really the way that works.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 I think that's 5 basis points.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I think, you may be -- I mean, I don't know if it's part of your question or not, but there's, of course, the increase in IOER, and there's some pretty simple math you can view there about 5 basis points on -- or 10 basis points on $0.5 trillion for half a year. So -- but those are pretty small numbers in the scheme of global precision we're dealing with here.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst




 OK, thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks.Operator




A follow-up question is coming from the line from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open now.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Jeremy, I just wanted to follow-up. Can you give us some color about the residential mortgage lending business? How was the gain-on-sale margins this quarter? Any outlook on margins or any outlook on volumes, I should say? But also, did you say also that you guys sustained a small loss or a loss in the servicing area? If so, what drove that? Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about mortgage, which is a business I'm still learning. But we've had very robust originations, $40 billion this quarter. I think the most significant -- one of the significant things that's going on is we've really finished unwinding all of our credit pullbacks from the crisis. So we're fully back in the corresponding channel, which is obviously helping the volumes. There's obviously been a huge refi boom over the last year with lower rates. That's starting to slow down a little bit. The purchase market has been quite robust, although now we've seen so much home price appreciation that maybe affordability starts to be a little bit of a headwind. So as we sit here today from a margin perspective, you have your kind of typical dynamics. As rates go up a little bit, refi slows down a little bit that the industry has built capacity. You have probably a little bit of a margin headwind looking forward. And obviously, there's a mix effect. So as corresponding becomes a much bigger part of the originations, you have mix-based margin compression. So -- and obviously...




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer I think Gerard said that was the all-time highs. And now it's not even normal. It's just getting low on all-time-highs.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, exactly. So it's a headwind relative to a super elevated prior-year quarter, but it's still run perfectly healthy. In terms of the servicing business, I think, really, as you all understand, in the current environment, the prepayment rates, prepayment speeds have been running significantly above our model forecast. And so as we continue to really update those as part of our risk management, that can prevent some small risk management losses.




 But in general, the risk management of the parts of the MSR that can be managed has actually been very good and very stable. So I think that's everything you had, Gerard, right?Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yes. Thank you very much.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yup.OperatorThere are no incoming questions in the queue.Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer




 OK. Just want to end, I just want to thank Jen Piepszak, for a great job. She's our new CFO. You'll also know she's happy with these guys in their new job. And Jeremy, I know a lot of you know Jeremy, but he's been the CFO of the IB for seven or eight or eight years or so, so a complete professional. And so Jeremy, welcome to your first call, and congratulations. So...Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Jamie.




Jamie Dimon -- Chief Executive Officer Talk to you all soon. Thank you.Jeremy Barnum -- Chief Financial Officer Well, they survived it.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q1 2021 Earnings CallApr 14, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter 2021 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.3 billion, EPS of $4.50 on revenue of 33.1 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 29%. Included in these results are two significant items: 5.2 billion of net credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly; and a $550 million contribution to the firm's foundation in the form of equity investments. Touching on a few highlights, we saw another strong quarter in CIB. In fact, net income was an all-time record with IV fees up 57% year on year, reflecting continued robust activity, and markets up 25% year on year as the environment remained favorable in January and February, although it did start to normalize in March. In AWM, we had record net long-term inflows of 48 billion this quarter.And deposits of 2.2 trillion were up 36% year on year and 5% sequentially as the Fed balance sheet continues to expand, but loan growth remains muted, up 1% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter with the bright spots being AWM and secured lending in CIB. On to Page 2 for more detail on our results. When looking at this quarter's performance, there's a lot of noise in the year-on-year comparisons, particularly given what happened in March of last year. And so it's important to remember a few key points here about March of 2020. Effectively, investment banking activity stopped or got delayed, except for investment-grade debt issuance. We recorded 950 million of losses in credit adjustments in other and CIB, as well as a $900 million markdown on our bridge book. And in credit, we built 6.8 billion of reserves relative to this quarter's release of 5.2 billion. So with that in mind, revenue of 33.1 billion was up 4.1 billion or 14% year on year.




 Net interest income was down 1.6 billion or 11%, primarily driven by lower rates. And noninterest revenue was up 5.7 billion or 39%. While this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items I just mentioned, in absolute terms, we saw strong fee generation across the franchise, including in investment banking, AWM, and home lending as well as a strong performance in markets. Expenses of 18.7 billion were up 12% year on year on higher volume and revenue-related expenses, the contribution to the foundation that I just mentioned, as well as continued investments. And credit costs were a net benefit of 4.2 billion driven by reserve releases. And here, it's worth noting that charge-offs were down about 400 million year on year or 28%, and continue to trend near historical lows. Turning to Page 3 for more detail on our reserves. We released approximately 5.2 billion of reserves this quarter as recent economic data has been consistently positive, indicating that the recovery may be accelerating faster than we would have thought just a few months ago. Starting with consumer, in card, we released 3.5 billion. As the employment picture has continued to improve, the round three stimulus has provided another level of support, and early stage delinquencies remain very low. And in home lending, we released 625 million, primarily driven by continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent, portfolio runoff. And then in wholesale, we released approximately 700 million. While a strong recovery seems in motion, we're also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets. So for now, we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios, and that about 26 billion were reserved at approximately 7 billion above the current base case. However, it's worth noting that even in a more normalized environment, we wouldn't expect to be 100% weighted to the base case as we'll always have some weighting on alternative scenarios. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4.




 We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat versus the prior quarter, as net growth in retained earnings was offset by lower AOCI and higher RWA. Perhaps the more interesting ratio right now is SLR, which is at 5.5%, excluding the temporary relief that just expired. As we've said all along, we were never going to rely on short-term temporary relief as a long-term planning matter, and this is evidenced by actions we've taken. We've already engaged with our wholesale deposit clients to explore solutions, and we issued 1.5 billion of preferred stock in the first quarter. Having said that, it's worth reinforcing a few points here. First, it's important to remember that the SLR is a leverage-based requirement, not a risk-based requirement. The growth in bank leverage has been driven by deposits and therefore, cannot be cured by reducing lending. In fact, the opposite would be true. If we had more loan growth, it would help because it would absorb excess risk-based capital. The issue is that we've had muted loan demand to date. And even if it starts to pick up, it's hard to envision that organic loan growth could keep pace with further QE. And therefore, we expect this leverage issue to persist for some time. And finally, when a bank is leverage constrained, this lowers the marginal value of any deposit, regardless if it is wholesale or retail, operational or nonoperational. And regulators should consider whether requiring banks to hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome. As we told you last quarter, we have levers to manage SLR, and we will. However, raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run.




 And then just to wrap up on capital. Regarding distributions, the limitations were extended another quarter. So based on our income, that corresponds to buyback capacity of about 7.4 billion in the second quarter after paying our $0.90 dividend. Given the preferreds we plan to issue and the work under way around excess client deposits, while, of course, this could become more challenging, we believe that we should be able to buy back most, if not all, of that capacity. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 5. CCB reported net income of 6.7 billion, including reserve releases of 4.6 billion. Starting with the key drivers of the year-on-year financial performance, which I'll just note, have generally been consistent over the last few quarters against the backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets with higher savings rates and investments as well as healthy deleveraging. Deposit growth was 32% or $240 billion as existing customers' balances remain elevated, and we also continue to acquire new customers. Client investment assets were up 44%, driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. Home lending originations were 39 billion, up 40% in an overall larger market. And auto loan and lease originations were 11.2 billion, up 35%, with March being the best month on record. However, loans were down 7% as outstandings in card remain lower even as spend is recovering to pre-COVID levels. This is in addition to the continued runoff of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by PPP additions. Mobile users grew 9% to nearly 42 million, and the customer migration to digital continued with branch transactions still down double digits. In consumer banking, approximately 50% of new checking and savings accounts were opened digitally, and that's up more than 10 percentage points year on year. Notably, we're also seeing a few emerging trends worth covering.




 Consumer sentiment has returned to more normalized levels, reflecting increased optimism. We've seen debit and credit card spend returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 9% year on year and 14% versus 1Q '19, despite T&E remaining significantly lower. That said, we are seeing strong momentum in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March compared to February and similar growth across CX loyalty and ultimate reward travel bookings. With higher rates, mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi applications have slowed, but the overall market is still robust. And on credit, government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence that the bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough. Taken together with the pace of the vaccine rollout, we believe there are some permanent to the loss mitigation. And while 1Q '21 card losses are higher quarter on quarter, we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters. In summary, revenue of 12.5 billion was down 6% year on year driven by deposit margin compression and lower card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue. Expenses of 7.2 billion were down 1% as we self-fund our investments. And credit costs were a net benefit of 3.6 billion, driven by the 4.6 billion of reserve releases I previously mentioned, partially offset by net charge-offs of a billion. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of 5.7 billion and an ROE of 27% on record first-quarter revenue of 14.6 billion. Investment banking revenue of 2.9 billion was up 67% year on year, excluding the impact of the bridge book markdown last year. IB fees of 3 billion were up 57%. And while we now ranked No. 2, largely due to SPAC IPOs, we maintained our global IB wallet share of 9%.




 The quarter's performance was an all-time record, driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance markets as well as robust activity in M&A and DCM. In advisory, we were up 35%, benefiting from the surge in announcement activity in the second half of 2020. Debt underwriting fees were up 17%, driven by leveraged finance activity. And here, we maintained our No. 1 rank and lead left position. And in equity underwriting, fees were up more than 200%, primarily driven by IPOs as clients continue to take advantage of strong market conditions. Looking forward, the IPO calendar is expected to remain active with M&A momentum likely to continue. And while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline, both this year and last year, make it difficult to predict the second quarter. So at this point, I'd say we expect IB fees to be about flat year on year. Moving to markets, total revenue was 9.1 billion, up 25% against the strong prior-year quarter. In January and February, we saw a robust trading environment, and client activity remained elevated with the positive momentum from the end of 2020 carrying through to the start of the year. In March, our performance started to normalize but remained above pre-COVID levels. Fixed income was up 15% with outperformance in securitized products and credit, supported by active primary and secondary markets, partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency and emerging markets against the tough compare in March of last year. Equity markets was up 47% and an all-time record, driven by a favorable trading environment in equity derivatives as well as strong client activity across products. In terms of outlook, based on recent weeks, we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second quarter of 2019, as 2Q '20 was the best quarter on record for our markets franchise, but obviously, it's still early. Wholesale payments and security services revenues were 1.4 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, both down 2% year on year, with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression.




 Expenses of 7.1 billion were up 19% year on year on higher revenue-related compensation, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of 331 million, driven by the reserve releases I discussed earlier. Now let's go to commercial banking on Page 7. Commercial banking reported net income of 1.2 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of 2.4 billion was up 11% year on year with higher lending and investment banking revenue in the absence of a prior year markdown in the bridge book, partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of 1.1 billion was up 65% with broad-based strength as market conditions remain favorable. Expenses of 969 million were down 2% driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $291 billion were up 54% year on year and 5% quarter on quarter as client balances remain elevated. And loans were down 2% year on year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity, partially offset by additional PPP funding. And CRE loans were down 1% with continued low origination volumes in commercial term lending, partially offset by increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of 118 million driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 29 million driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on Page 8. Asset and wealth management generated record net income of 1.2 billion with pre-tax margin of 40% and ROE of 35%. For the quarter, revenue of 4.1 billion was up 20% year on year as higher management fees, growth in deposit and loan balances, as well as investment valuation gains, were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.6 billion were up 6% with higher volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by lower structural expense.




 And credit costs were a net benefit of $121 million, primarily due to reserve releases. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows of 48 billion were again positive across all channels, asset classes, and regions, with particular strength in equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of 44 billion as banks encourage clients to move excess deposits away from them. AUM of 2.8 trillion and overall client assets of 3.8 trillion, up 28% and 32% year on year, respectively, were driven by higher market levels as well as strong net inflows. And finally, deposits were up 43% and loans were up 18%, with strength in security-based lending, custom lending, and mortgages. Now on to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $580 million. Revenue was a loss of 473 million, down 639 million year on year. Net interest income was down nearly 700 million on lower rates, as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. And expenses of 876 million were up 730 million year on year, primarily driven by the contribution to the foundation I mentioned earlier. The results for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the firm's expected full-year tax rate relative to the level of pre-tax income this quarter. So with that, moving to the outlook on Page 10. You'll see here that our 2021 NII outlook of around 55 billion remains in line with our previous guidance, as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being offset by customer behavior in card. It's worth noting that forecasting NII is perhaps more challenging than it's been in a long time as many of the key inputs, market-implied rates, deposit forecast, securities reinvestment, and customer behavior in card are all quite fluid. And as a reminder, while customer deleveraging and higher payment rates in card is a headwind for NII, it's a tailwind for credit. And we now expect our card net charge-off rate to be around 250 basis points for the year.




 And then on expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately 70 billion, with the largest driver being higher volume and revenue-related expenses, which importantly have offsets in revenue. So to wrap up, the year has gotten off to a strong start, and a robust economic recovery seems under way. Of course, there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that we're preparing for as well as specific issues that we're facing, including the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned, the rate environment and tough year-on-year comparisons, among other things. Having said that, the earnings power of the franchise remains evident, and we'll continue to use our resources to serve our clients, customers, and communities. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you noted during a December conference that you believe that normalized ROTCE for JPMorgan would be about 17%.




 And investors were wondering, as we think about JPMorgan perhaps cementing a higher G-SIB surcharge at 4% this year, is 17% still achievable under that context or constraint?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Go ahead, Jen.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Erika, I'll start. So just a couple of things to think about on capital. So while we're -- we ended the year in the 4% bucket for G-SIB, and it's probably worth mentioning, given the continued expansion of the system through the Fed balance sheet, even staying in 4% could become challenging for us. But just a couple of things to keep in mind there is we believe that -- we do have offsets in the stress capital buffer and we do believe that it's very possible that we'll see those come through in this round. Of course, it's dependent upon the Fed models, not our models. But we've talked about things that -- actions that we've taken sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held to maturity that should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario-dependent, but we do expect some benefit there that could offset.




 It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel three endgame. And the indication from the Fed is that they will address G-SIB recalibration as part of that. And so it's quite possible that we see G-SIB recalibration, but perhaps another constraint that we'll be managing. So there is a lot that we'll learn over probably the next year or two. And of course, the higher G-SIB doesn't come into effect until the first quarter of '23. So we do think we have offsets. We're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us, of course, given what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel three endgame to really understand what we're dealing with. And at that 12% in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about rates, it would also be about loan demand, 17% still feels achievable for us.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Got it. And thank you for going through some of the leverage constraints now that SLR has been -- exemption has expired. The investors have also been wondering, as we think about your opportunity to continue to facilitate the economic recovery globally, does the constraint on SLR and the moving pieces on G-SIB change your priorities in terms of timing or sizing of the $30 billion buyback or inorganic growth opportunities that you've mentioned in the past?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I would say, broadly speaking, no, but an important point there on SLR, we obviously -- the levers we have are issuing preferreds. We can retain more common. But we're also working closely with wholesale clients in a very selective way, as I mentioned, to find alternatives for excess deposits. So it is true that common is one of the levers, although I will say that while it might give us more flexibility, it comes at a much greater cost. So at this point, given what we know and what we expect, we don't expect that we would have to retain more common. We think we can manage this through issuing more preferreds and working closely with our clients to find alternatives. So I would say, broadly speaking, no. The G-SIB constraints, as we've been saying for years now, is one that will become increasingly challenging for us.




 And now particularly with the expansion of the system, it's even more challenging than perhaps it was just a few years ago, but we're managing through that as well.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hi, John.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, Jen. I wanted to ask about expenses. Obviously, you've raised the outlook by a billion dollars a few times the last couple times you've spoken. I guess, in terms of the increase that you announced today to the outlook, can you give a little more color on how much of that is volume and revenue related as opposed to the other buckets you talked about in January, which were investments in structural?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Sure. So the increase from the 69 billion, which was the guidance we gave in the K, is almost entirely volume and revenue-related. And so there, I'll just make an important point that it's volume and revenue-related. So as an example, volumes in CCB, just given the environment, they are very valuable for long-term franchise revenue growth, but we may not see that revenue growth in the near term. But as we always say, we're -- we don't manage displaced for one quarter or even one year. So there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth you would anticipate over the long run, but it's almost entirely volume and revenue-related. There are a few other things like marketing expense that, given the strength of the recovery that we expect, we now expect to lean more in on marketing expense in the second half of the year. So that's part of it as well.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. And I guess the follow-up would be does that necessarily mean that it's more concentrated the increase in the first quarter because you had such a big quarter. And are there COVID-related costs that you have in your numbers this year that might come out over time?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Obviously, some of it is in the first quarter, but things like further volume-related expenses like I talked about or marketing, they're less so in the first quarter. And then what was your other question?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer COVID.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer COVID. Those numbers are lower than they were even last year and included in the outlook, but not material in the grand scheme of things.




OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Glenn.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hello there. So if you're right on the economy, which I think a lot of us think you are, we're starting to see the spend part of the pickup now, as you mentioned, across credit and debit and some of the P&A. So my question is how do you think about the staging of the lens part? Both consumer and corporates are so flushed with all that liquidity. How do you think about the timing for loan growth? And if I could get a consumer versus wholesale comment, that would be great.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So you used the right word, which is demand, and it really is all about demand, which, of course, is quite healthy, particularly as it relates to consumer when you think about the amount of deleveraging that we've seen through this process. So there, we do expect a second-half pickup because, as you say, we first have to see spend recover before we see relevering on the consumer side. And then it is also true even for small business, which is obviously part of CCB.




 Their demand has been very low given the support that's available through PPP. And so that will likely pick up in the second half as well. And then elsewhere, AWM has been strong throughout, and we see that continuing. And then on the CIB side, I mean, that's always lumpy and deal dependent, but that's active as well. And we do see within secured lending opportunities there across asset classes. Again, that's a bit more opportunistic. And then in the commercial bank, given the level of support, the amount of liquidity in the markets as well as the amount of cash on balance sheet, loan growth there has been muted and probably will be for some time. But again, that's incredibly healthy ultimately for the recovery. And so whether we see that pick up later this year or next year remains to be seen, but it's all for good reasons.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




 I appreciate that. Maybe I'll just ask one follow-up on the deposit side. Obviously, deposit growth has been incredibly strong. So the two-parter is what do you think happens on the deposit side as the economy goes down the path that you've outlined? And what do you do with the deposit money in the meantime? Because I saw it loud and clear, Jamie's comments on It's hard to justify the price of U.S. debt. So what are we doing with all that liquidity in the meantime?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So first of all, I would say that deposits are going to be driven by the Fed balance sheet and to some extent, obviously, by bank lending. But given the demand picture there, you can think of it in the near term is all being driven by Fed balance sheet expansion. And so we obviously continue to expect significant deposit growth, which is why we've been talking about this so much. And then just in terms of how we deploy it, you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarter over quarter.




 And there, it's just important to remember that, for sure, we are being patient in the investment securities portfolio. That is true. I'll also mention that we are -- because of the steepening of the yield curve, we are less short. Banks will drift long in a sell-off. And so that has been part of the dynamic as well, but they're short-term cash deployment also. And so what we saw there was when repo markets fall below IOER, we're going to hold that short-term cash deployment in IOER relative to the repo market. So you'll see that dynamic on our balance sheet as well.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Ken.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hey, Jen. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you can elaborate on that.




 You mentioned the record investment banking pipeline and flattish year over year as a best guess. I was wondering if you could talk about the mix dynamics there. Obviously, the first quarter was just ridiculously great in terms of the ECM markets. And can you just give us a flavor of just where you see activity? And how much is that underwriting activity potentially dampening what might be happening on the commercial loan side?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Well, I'll start with the latter, which is it's absolutely been very, very supportive of corporates. And therefore, it has a lot to do with what we're seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates. And then in terms of the mix, we expect ECM and M&A to continue. But on DCM, there's a lot of flow activity that doesn't necessarily get represented in a pipeline because it's high-velocity type activity. We saw that in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see that now, which is why I said it makes it a little bit difficult to predict the second quarter. So while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, there is still a lot of high-velocity activity. And so that's why we think that the quarter will be flattish year over year despite the very high pipeline.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let's call him. Let's see. Can you guys hear me?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 'Cause we can't hear you anymore. I'm gonna put you on mute for a minute.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Jamie is traveling. So we have him on Zoom. I know everybody can appreciate technology challenges 'cause we've all had them over the last year.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Great, Jen. And my -- just my follow-up.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jen, just keep on going 'cause I can hear the questions. I can hear you, but you're doing a great job, and you don't really need me.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Well, thank you. I'm sure I'll need you at some point, so I hope they're on that. Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yes. No problem, Jen. OK. So the second one is just with regards to the comments that you guys have made for a while about looking at acquisition opportunities. Just wondering just how is the interplay between everything you've talked about already on balance sheet capacity and ongoing deposit growth and limitations on CET1 and SLR versus how you make potential decisions around usage of capital and an acquisition capacity?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. It's a great question. Interestingly, the issue is not that we don't have capital available to make those types of decisions. The issue is that we have the wrong binding constraint. So the binding constraint is leveraged, not risk-based. And so it doesn't change the way we think about acquisitions at all. In fact, acquisitions and/or increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between leverage and risk-based. And so we would love to be able to absorb some of our CET1 through acquisitions because, as I said, it sort of just brings the balance back into focus. The issue is that its leverage-based constraint that is the constraint, and we're in a low rate environment with low loan demand and very strong deposit growth. So it's the combination of all those things that makes leverage the binding constraint, but it doesn't change the way we're thinking about acquisitions.Operator




Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Hey, Jen. Hey. Thanks for the time. Jen, a question on card and looking at the net charge-offs. You gave us the full year of 2.5%. And I know you spent a lot of time in card earlier in your career. So maybe you could give us some sense on how you're thinking about the ""normalization"" of that loss content over time. When I think back to the bankruptcy, changes in the 'OOs, it took many years for consumers to relever. And I'm wondering, given your background there, could you give us a sense as to what is different this time? And are there time frames historically we should look at for what a normal course like releveraging back to normal of that card loss content should be? How do you think about that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. I would say, first of all, it's difficult to find a historical comparison that's totally relevant here because I don't think we've ever seen this amount of support in the system, which came, of course, on top of an already reasonably healthy consumer. So it's difficult to find the historical perspective. But I will say the 2.5%, I mean, pre-COVID, we would have thought that our loss rate in card this year would have been 3.3%, 3.5% So it just gives you a sense there of that tailwind on credit is significant. And in terms of what it's going to take for consumers to relever, I mean, we do expect there to be significant economic activity in the second half. And so that could come quite naturally, but it could come a little bit later, given the amount of deleveraging we've seen. But the fact that we already see spend above pre-COVID levels, and obviously, we still have restrictions in place, particularly around T&E on consumers' ability to spend, when that comes back, we do think that we'll see spend tick even higher. And that will be a point where perhaps we'll start to see that delevering. But it is difficult to know. It's a great question.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 OK. And then the follow-up I have, on your comments around the NII guide and the fact that it's hard to forecast. I got a couple of questions in this morning just on, hey. Why do you think it's flat versus prior guide given the curve has deepened? And also deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given QE's continuing this full year? So is there some spread angle that you're kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted? Is it more the loan growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. I think it's probably all of the above, Betsy, but starting with the steepening of the yield curve. So If you look at the earnings at risk disclosure, I mean, we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows, which is since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25, 30 basis points. So that is incorporated in the outlook, but it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in card in terms of higher payment rates, and we haven't started to see relevering as we were just talking about, even though spend has recovered. So card, the impacts of card completely offset the steepening of the yield curve. You also mentioned loan growth, which is critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve. And then I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook, the fact that we have been patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration. And then also, it's probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small given the fact that, that deployment opportunities are minimal.




 And so you can think about them as being something less than 10 basis points because we do have pay rates above zero. So it's something less than 10 basis points. So the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't add a whole lot in this environment anyway.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hi, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. Hey, Jennifer. My question is for Jamie. And, Jamie, your philosophy is to invest through a downturn and you're increasing your investments by one-fourth year over year. You already said that. But what's your philosophy about investing through a boom as you expect over the next three years? I mean, if the pie is growing, do your investments go higher? It looks like that's not the case with the guidance you guys gave.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So I think, Mike, the way to really look at it is it probably doesn't -- it isn't affected as much by boomer bus as you think. So we isolate opportunities like for -- and we're now sort of going to hire 300 black financial advisors. We're going to do that whether it's boomer bus. We're building new data centers. We're building new agile. We're going to the cloud. So I think it doesn't really change that much over time. I just think you'll probably see our investments go over time not go down. We can get plenty of organic growth opportunities, which we want to invest in.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And then how much are you spending in climate? Your 66 pages CEO letter was, I guess, that's like a -- could be a third of a book almost, but you really had the table on climate risk and what you guys need to do. How much are you actually spending? And what's the payback on that spending for shareholders, or is this really an ESG reputational benefit you're looking for?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I'll start there, Mike. And then, Jamie, you can chime in. But climate is a long game, obviously, and we're investing a lot of effort in our ESG initiatives, not only because they have a positive impact on society and communities, but because they're also important to our clients, customers, and our shareholders. So we don't exactly think about it that way, Mike.




 But we've also invested in multiple teams to help clients through the transition, and we do recognize it's a transition, and clients appreciate that. We've also made the Paris-aligned financing commitment last year, and we're going to release our annual ESG report next month, so you'll see more there. And then we also committed to finance $200 billion toward climate action and sustainable development, and we're continuing to grow those efforts as well. And in fact, your question is quite timely because we're planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about long-term scaling of our financing efforts here. So much more detail to come shortly on that. But, Jamie, I don't know if you wanna add anything.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good morning.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Maybe -- just maybe a question on the bank SLR, which I think was a bit more of a constraint even than the firmwide SLR. Just, I guess, two questions related to that. What kind of flexibility do you have to kind of manage the difference between the two moving assets out of the bank perhaps? And then just if you have any updates or thoughts on potential changes that regulators are discussing to kind of give maybe Relief 2.0 in a more permanent sense on the SLR.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So the bank SLR, I mean, broadly speaking, it's going to be the same levers. We do have a little bit more flexibility, as you note, because we can move things -- we can inject capital into the bank from the holding company. So it's a little bit more flexible. But generally speaking, the constraints and the levers are the same.




 And then in terms of changes, we know what you know. And so we look forward to a proposal. The only thing I can mention is, of course, the difference between the U.S. and Europe on Basel as it relates to SLR is there, it's a 3% plus half-year G-SIB. And so we have a constant 2% buffer. And so with that, you get the flexibility in a Basel-compliant way to exclude deposits at Central Banks for a period of time. So it's possible that it could look something like that, but we don't know.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So I think there's too much focus there. We run the business do a great job servicing clients over time. We manage -- God knows how many different capital liquidity contents. We have multiple levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients.




 If we've got to adjust our strategy going forward, so be it. We'll probably be fine. I think the question you used to be asking isn't what it means for us, it's what it means to the marketplace? I've already mentioned several times, we have $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, which we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways into the marketplace with repo or just financing positions or helping people because of these constraints. So the constraints are more of a constraint on the economy than they are on JPMorgan Chase. We will find a way, regardless of any constraints, to do things. The other thing is G-SIB, the SLR, they're all these couple things, they need to be recalibrated. And I think people have been asking why how would you really do the best job for the United States and the people in the United States, not for JPMorgan. JPMorgan is going to be fine either way.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks.




OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Gerard.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, Jen. How are you?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Good. Yes.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Question, I apologize if you addressed this. I had to jump off for a minute here. But can you share with us on the service -- mortgage servicing business, it looked like you had a small loss this quarter similar to the fourth quarter. Can you tell us some of the metrics that went into why the servicing business recorded a small loss?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, gosh, Gerard. I'm not even sure, but Reggie and the team can follow up with you.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Very good. And the second question has to do with when we go back to the day one loan loss reserves established in January 1st, 2020, for you and your peers under CECL accounting, if I recall, I think your loan loss reserves to total loans at the time were approximately 1.87%. Today, they're approximately 2.42%. I know you guys gave some color on your outlook for what you think credit will look like. You're being a little more conservative. But can you share with us what would it take to bring the reserves back down to the day one levels that we saw in January 1, 2020?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Well, it's very difficult to try to compare today to just taking our balance sheet today, taking the profile of our portfolio today and compare it to CECL day one because we are very far away from that, in fact, in a very healthy way. So that's very difficult to do. What I will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process in the first quarter. And we obviously expect things to be -- we expect the recovery to be robust in the second half of the year. And so if we continue to see that, if we continue to see labor markets recover, if we continue to see vaccine rollout be successful, we would have future releases from here. But I would note importantly that the $7 billion, that is the distance between our reserve and the base case, is just for context. We will always have weightings on alternative scenarios. And so all else equal, which is there's a lot in the all else equal bucket, but we would release something less than $7 billion. So difficult to compare back to CECL day one, but there could be further releases ahead.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 One of the negatives to CECL, which I pointed out right at the beginning, that we spent a lot of time on these calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank, which is these are multiple scenarios, hypothetical, probability-based. And obviously, the more volatile environment, the more volatile these numbers. If a base case was $20 billion, and we now have something like 30, we're not going to be taking down a lot of reserves now because you always -- as Jen said, you're always going to have an extreme adverse case. Think of it like kind of a CCAR test, and you always have a percentage of reserves up for that permanently. And so always -- hopefully, I mean, my view is we should waste a lot less time in CECL that makes almost no difference for the company in general.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And then back on your servicing point, I got the answer. It's updates to the MSR model. So HPI updates, prepay updates. So it's less about the operation and more about the MSR model update.




OperatorNext question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Matt.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. I wanted to ask about the CEO letter where there was talk about being open to fintech deals, which is something you've talked about in the past. But what type of deals would you be interested in? And I guess, could it be material to JPMorgan as we think about whether it's your strategy or financial impact?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So remember, we're after paying a steady careful dividend stuff like that. We much prefer to invest in our business organically, including the acquisitions and buying back stock. We're buying back stock because our cup run is over. We have 13.6% capital to risk-weighted -- to advanced risk-weighted assets.




 We're earning a tremendous sum of money, and we really have no option right now. But I think the door is open to anything that makes sense. So we've already done InstaMed, which is an electronic digital payments platform between providers and consumers in healthcare. We did 55 IP, which is a tax way -- a tax-efficient way of managing money, and we're looking at tons of things ourselves. Some were billing ourselves like Dynamo. Some of it are part of the -- we've got investments in probably a hundred different... hundreds of points to be either partner with or like, but we're completely open-minded. It could be payments. It could be asset management. It could be adjacency. It could be data. It could be anything like that. But it cannot be a U.S. bank. So we're just reminding people, if you got great ideas for us, let us know.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And as the mentality and Fintech specifically, is it to potentially accelerate from the investments that you would have done on your own or to add capabilities or maybe protect what you already have?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, it's a little of everything. Because you see us adding Chase My Plan and Chase By Loan and obviously see competing a little bit of buy now, pay later. You see us doing Chase offers a compete with people. You see us doing Zelle payments.




 And we've got tons of fabulous stuff coming. We did do invest a couple of years ago. We had a very good quarter. We're adding robo investing, which is just getting going. So we're adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum. And you're going to see a lot more. And you're going to see personalization of apps. And if you go into the payment system, you're going to see Global Wallets. You're going to see tons of stuff is coming. And like I said, the fintech has done a great job. I'd point to add that they live under different constraints. But they've done a great job getting rid of pain points, making automated, digitizing things using the cloud. It's incumbent upon us to go faster to the cloud. We already have 150 major AI projects. But my guess is in five years, it will be a thousand AI project. So we're going as fast as we can to do a great job for customers.




 And obviously, fintech will be a challenge. There's a lot of money there. They're very smart people. I want to be clear. We're not wishing regulations on them like on us. I think it would be bad for America. But we are wishing for a level playing field when it comes to ramp certain products and certain services. I for one think it's grossly unfair that a neo bank can have a small checking account earn $200 in the Durbin fees, and we earn $100. That just isn't right. And I could go on and on and on about some of the unfair things. But look, let the regulars do it, I'm not expecting any change. We will just adjust and guide these accordingly.Operator




Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Brian.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst




 Hey. Hey. Good morning. I just have a quick question. I mean, as we start to look out to forward rates and market kind of implying Fed moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term. I mean, how are you guys thinking about deposit beta this cycle? And kind of what's included in your NII sensitivity, both on the consumer and commercial deposits?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So I think the way to answer is the betas have gamma, meaning they change over time. And we have our best guess in numbers that Jen gave you. So obviously, the beta is going up all the time. And then it levels off.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right. And so the betas have gamma, like I'd say that you can think of it as being nonlinear, meaning the beta for the first hundred basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of a hundred basis points. And so from here, on the retail side specifically, the first hundred basis points will be very valuable because there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the benefit in NII with short rates in an environment with low loan growth.




OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales Partners.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hello.




OperatorAnd, Mr. Peabody, your line is open. Please ensure that you do not have your line on mute.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst Hello? Can you hear me now?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hello. Go ahead. Yes. We can hear you. Go ahead.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst




 Sorry about that. I had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve might have on your entity. Specifically, if we -- you touched a little bit on the IOR rate and the overnight repo rate being raised. Would that have any impact on your market-related NII if they had to raise by five basis points? Secondly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, is that incorporated in your $55 billion NII guidance? And then thirdly, If we do get negative rates at the short end, does that have any implications for what loan demand might look like?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So I'll just start by saying while we have seen repo go negative at times. It's been quarterly. And so we don't expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time or -- and we certainly haven't seen spikes, which is something you would worry about more. I think with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Fed increase their RRP facility, now that facility is at zero, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go negative for any meaningful period of time. They also obviously could increase that. And then for us, I would say, not a meaningful impact because obviously, we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for us, but we do trade around it.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I will just add, the why is far more important to the number. Like NII, obviously, like in trading, it goes in and out, the whole thing have been equal. No, it just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative NII because you're going back into recession because there's a negative variance. That's a whole different issue than it was a temporary timing thing. I would tell you, we would expect rates to be moving up over time, and we expect a rather healthy, very strong economy.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about. It's a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hi, Andrew.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi, Jen, Jamie. Morning. So just circling back to the SLR, despite issuing 1.5 billion preferreds, you still lost about 30 basis points on your SLR. I'm just wondering how you think about the ratio two or three quarters out from now, whether issuing preferreds and having your discussions with wholesale depositors because there's going to be enough to put a floor on the SLR at 5.5%? Or whether you're going to have to pull harder on that on those levers or have to pull hard on other levers?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. So the minimum is 5%. So we have some room. Naturally, we will have a buffer above the minimum as you always need to when you have binary consequences of going. So you can think about some management buffer above that, but we do still have room at 5.5%. And we do think that we can manage this at this point through issuing. We'll be in the market again with preferreds as well as the conversations that we've had with clients. So far, they have not been disruptive. We're hopeful that, that remains the case and that we can manage this.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst




 OK. So what was your level of comfort for the buffer above the 5%? That's my follow-on. And then just another question. You gave an update a couple of quarters ago saying that you had a buffer or, let's say, excess proficiency of about $10 billion versus your best-case scenario economic outlook. Obviously, you've released a lot of provisions since then. Can you give an update on what that figure is now?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So you can think about a buffer on the SLR of, call it, 25 basis points. There, it is important to note, something like AOCI is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of AOCI as that's part of tier one capital. So we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any noise we might see there.




 So that's why we have a buffer, and 25 basis points is probably a reasonable one to think about. In terms of the -- on reserves, the distance between where we are in the base case, as I said in my prepared remarks, that's now 7 billion. What's interesting to note is that that was 10 billion. It was then 9 billion, and we've released 8 billion, and it's still 7 billion. So all of the scenarios have been moving, and there are lots a lot that goes into how we think about reserves. We've always just provided that as context for everyone, particularly last year as we were managing through so much uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that because what I also said on the 7 billion is that you shouldn't think about that as available for release because we will always have some weighting on alternative scenarios. And so even if everything plays out exactly as we expect, based upon where we closed the books for the first quarter, it would be something less than 7 billion.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. I'm still wrestling with the deposit conundrum. So I guess your national deposit share is something like 12%. And over the last year, I think your incremental deposit share gain is 20%.




 And in others, the industry deposits were up around $3 trillion, and your deposits are up 600 billion. So I'm just wondering how much of that was due to QE? And how much of that is due to organic growth? And maybe you can fill us in because you're building out the branches in the lower 48 states? And you're expanding commercial bankers and trying to build up all this organic growth at a time when you can't really monetize those deposits.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So first of all, as we always say, we're running the place for the long term, and we don't expect this challenge to be a long-term challenge, maybe a short to medium term, but not a long term. And then I'll just say that, yes, there was certainly some organic growth, but it is Fed balance sheet and bank lending that create deposits. And so that's what we are focused on. And we do think, given what we expect here, that we can manage it. And it certainly isn't going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise as that is long-term franchise value.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think, Jen, another kind of -- hey, Mike, it's the 600, and it's really hard to see that. We think we're growing actual stair in almost every business deposits, but 500 to 600 was the Fed balance sheet. And we're a big wholesale bank and a big consumer bank. So obviously, a big portion of that shows up inside our company. And again, we try to -- the new brands are doing great, but they're not going to move the needle quite like the Fed adding 3 trillion to deposits in the systemJennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 That's right.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And just a quick update on the build-out into the 48 lower states branches, you said, by the middle of this year.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. Yes. So we'll be in all lower 48 by the end of July. Is that right? Yes. Reggie is confirming for me. We will be in all lower 48 by the end of July. We opened about 75 branches in market expansion. Last year, we got a little bit slowed down by COVID, but that's going to be about 150 this year. So we remain super excited about that. And all the opportunities that bring across the company, not just in deposits, of course, because it brings incredible value to the commercial bank and to the private bank. And so the business case there, if you will, is not just about deposits.Operator




Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Erika again.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Apologies for prolonging the call. I just got this question a lot on Bloomberg from investors. Just wanted to reask the first question another way. It seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the G-SIB for some time now. On the other hand, clearly, the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional revenue generation and market share taking and some opportunities. And so investors are wondering, if we don't get any sort of calibration that's meaningful and that CET1 floor does have to move up from 12%, what is the sensitivity of the normalized ROTCE outlook, if any at all, if that 12% does have to move up in 50 basis points increment?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So if the 12% has to move up, Erika, that would obviously have an impact. But there is so much between here and there and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only -- I know we've been waiting for G-SIB recalibration for a long time, but it has been made very clear that G-SIB recalibration will be part of the Basel three endgame, which we have also been waiting for, for a very long time. And so there will be potential offsets that we yet are not -- we're unable to manage because we don't know what they are yet.




 So we continue to wait for Basel three endgame. And then as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer. Again, it's scenario-dependent, but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset to G-SIB constraints. So we are thinking about that 12% number until we know something different.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And I'll just add, we're gonna finally kinda keep the 12, and we're pretty sure we can do it. So I'm not that worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up by -- if we're earning 20% tangible equity and our capital goes up by 5% and we get no return to 5%, our ROE goes to 19. So I don't understand the confusion. The underlying results are still fabulous and great and you have slight low returns. But I even think that will be temporary, we will, over time, find strategies and tactics to get returns to compare to our shareholders.




 But the most important of those returns, we have a great business, great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good service goes up, it controls goods. And that's what we really build all the time. It's there other stuff that just managing around capital constraints that It's a shame that this is -- I mean, this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We're spending time and is calling CECL and SLR, and it's a shame. And it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and over, we have one -- we have 2.2 trillion deposits, 1 trillion loans, 1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, much of which cannot be deployed to intermediate or lend. How conservative do you wanna get?Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst No. I agree. I think the market needed to hear that. Thank you.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q4 2020 Earnings CallJan 15, 2021, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorPlease stand by. We are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. It's slightly longer this quarter, given we're not having Investor Day. And so, after I review our results I'll spend some time on our outlook for 2021 as well as touch on a few important balance sheet topics that are top of mind for us. So, starting on Page 1 for the fourth quarter, the firm reported net income of $12.1 billion, EPS of $3.79 on revenue of $13.2 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 24%. Included in these results are approximately $3 billion of credit reserve releases. Before we get into more detail on our performance, I'll just touch on a few highlights.First off, our customers and clients continue to demonstrate strong financial resilience in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as evidenced in our credit metrics thus far. We saw continued momentum in investment banking and grew our share to 9.2%. In CIB markets, revenue was up 20% year on year, driven by strong client activity and elevated volatility in the quarter. And in AWM, we had record revenue of 10% year on year.




 On deposits, we saw another quarter of strong growth up 35% year on year, and 6% sequentially. And Fed balance sheet expansion continued to increase the overall amount of cash in the system while loan growth remains muted at 1% growth year on year and quarter on quarter. On to Page 2 for more on our fourth-quarter results. Revenue of $30.2 billion was up $1 billion, or 3% year on year. Net interest income was down approximately $900 million, or 7%, primarily driven by lower rates and mix, partly offset by balance sheet growth and higher markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion, or 13% on higher IB fees, legacy investment gains in corporate, and higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $16 million were down 2% year on year on lower volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by continued investments. Credit costs were a net benefit of $1.9 billion down $3.3 billion year on year, primarily driven by reserve releases of $2.9 billion that I'll cover in more detail shortly. Turning to the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $29.1 billion, EPS of $8.88 on record revenue of nearly $123 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Revenue was up $4.5 billion, or 4% year on year as net interest income was down $2.8 billion, or 5% on lower rates partly offset by higher markets NII and balance sheet growth. And noninterest revenue was up $7.3 billion, or 12% on higher markets and IB fees as well as higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $56.7 billion were up 2% year on year, driven by volume and revenue-related expenses, higher legal and continued investments, partially offset by lower structural expenses. And credit costs were $17.5 billion, reflecting a net reserve build of $12.2 billion due to the impacts of COVID-19 and net charge-offs that were down year on year. Now turning to reserves on Page 4. We released approximately $3 billion of reserves this quarter across wholesale and home lending.




 Starting with wholesale, we released $2 billion due to improving macroeconomic scenarios and the continued ability of our clients to access capital markets and liquidity. In home lending, we released $900 million, primarily on improvement in HPI expectations, and to a lesser extent, portfolio run-off. And in card, we held reserves flat as we remained cautious about the near term, especially with the number of unemployed still nearly two times pre-pandemic levels and potential payment shock coming to consumers from expiring benefits. And so with the near-term outlook still quite uncertain, we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios. And at nearly $31 billion, we are reserved at approximately $9 billion above the current base case. And to touch on net charge-offs for the quarter, they were down about $450 million year on year and remained relatively low across our portfolios. Looking forward, we still don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021. And with the recent stimulus, it could be even later. Turning to Page 5. We've included here an update on our customer assistance programs, and you can see the trends are largely similar to last quarter and further evidence of the resilience of our customers. The vast majority of what's left in deferral is in mortgage with $10 billion of own loans and $13 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we're seeing from our customers that have exited relief, more than 90% of accounts remained current. Turning to balance sheet and capital on Page 6. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat versus the prior quarter on strong earnings generation, largely offset by dividends of $2.8 billion and higher RWA. As we stated in our press release last month, the board has authorized share repurchases and we plan to resume buybacks in the first quarter up to our Fed authorized capacity of $4.5 billion after paying our $0.90 dividend. You can see here on the page, we've included the liquidity coverage ratio for both the firm and the bank, which we believe is important to look at together in order to better understand the liquidity profile of our balance sheet.




 The firm is at a healthy LCR of 110%. However, the bank LCR is 160%, reflecting the extraordinary deposit growth that has meaningfully outpaced loan demand. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on Page 7. In the fourth quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32%. Revenue of $12.7 billion was down 8% year on year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue. Deposit growth was 30% year on year, up over $200 billion as balances remain elevated and as we continue to acquire new customers and deepening primary relationships. Loans were down 6% year on year with home lending down due to portfolio run-off and card down on lower spend, offset by business banking, which was up due to PPP loans. Client investment assets were up 17% year on year, driven by both net inflows and market performance. On spend, combined debit and credit card sales volume in the quarter was up 1% year on year, which reflected debit sales of 12%, largely driven by retail and everyday spend and credit sales down 4%, largely driven by T&E. In home lending, overall production margins remained strong. Total originations were down 2% year on year but were up 12% quarter on quarter, both driven by correspondent and we lean into the minister channel after pulling back earlier in the year. For the year, total originations were $114 billion, including nearly $73 billion of consumer originations, both the highest since 2013. In auto, loan and lease origination volume was $11 billion, up 29% year on year. And across the franchise, digital engagement continues to accelerate. Our customers use quick deposit for more than 40% of all check deposits, which is nearly 10 percentage points higher than a year ago. And in home lending, nearly two-thirds of our consumer applications were completed digitally using Chase My Home, and that has tripled since the first quarter.




 Over 69% -- overall, 69% of our customers are digitally active with business banking at 86%, both higher than a year ago. Expenses of $7 billion were down 1% year on year and credit costs were a net benefit of $83 million, driven by $900 million of reserve releases in home lending, largely offset by net charge-offs in card of $767 million. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 8. CIB reported net income of $5.3 billion and an ROE of 26% on revenue of $11.4 billion for the fourth quarter and an ROE of 20% on revenue of $49 billion for the full year. The extraordinary nature of this year has meant that we had records in almost every category for both the quarter and the full year. In investment banking, IB fees were up 25% for the year and we grew share to its highest level in a decade. In the quarter, investment banking revenue of $2.5 billion was up 37% year on year, and up 20% sequentially. The quarter's performance was driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance market as well as strong performances in DCM and M&A. In advisory, we were up 19% year on year, driven by the closing of several large transactions. The M&A market continued to strengthen this quarter, and in fact, announced volumes exceeded pre-COVID levels. Debt underwriting fees were up 23% year on year, driven by leverage finance activity and we maintained our number one rank overall. In equity underwriting, fees were up 88% year on year, primarily driven by a strong performance in follow-ons and IPOs. Looking forward, we expect IB fees to be up modestly for the first quarter and the overall pipeline remains robust. We expect M&A to remain active on improved overall CEO confidence and the momentum in equity capital markets is expected to continue, of course dependent on a successful containment of COVID. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5.9 billion, up 20% year on year against the record fourth quarter last year.




 Fixed income was up 15% year on year, driven by good client activity across businesses, particularly in spread products as well as the favorable trading environment in currencies and emerging markets, credit, and commodities. Equities was up 32% year on year, driven by strong client activity and equity derivative and cash throughout the quarter across both flow trading and large episodic transactions. Looking forward, we expect markets to remain active in the first quarter and we have seen strong performance since the start of January, but it's obviously too early to predict the full quarter. And for the remaining quarters of this year and the full year, the comparison will be particularly challenging given the extraordinary performance of markets in 2020. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year on year, primarily reflecting the reporting reclass in merchant services. And securities services revenue of $1.1 billion was down 1% year on year. On a full-year basis, a headwind from lower rates were almost entirely offset by robust deposit growth. Expenses of $4.9 billion were down 9% compared to the prior year, driven by lower compensation and legal expenses. Now let's go to commercial banking on Page 9. Commercial banking reported net income of $2 billion and an ROE of 36%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 7% year on year with higher lending and investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Record growth investment banking revenue of $971 million was up 53% year on year. And the full year was also a record, finishing at $3.3 billion, surpassing our previously established $3 billion long-term target. And given our investments in bank coverage, we believe there is continued upside from here. Expenses of $950 million were flat year on year. Deposits of $277 billion were up 52% year on year, and 11% quarter on quarter as client balances remain elevated.




 Average loans were up 1% year on year, but down 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% on our revolver balances with utilization rates nearing record lows as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity. And CRE loans were down 1% on higher prepayment activity in both CTL and real estate banking. Finally, credit cards were a net benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by reserve releases. Now on to asset and wealth management on Page 10. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $786 million with a pre-tax margin and ROE of 29%. And for the year, AWM generated record net income of $3 billion with pre-tax margin and ROE of 28%. For the quarter, revenue of $3.9 billion was up 10% year on year as higher performance and management fees, as well as growth in deposit and low balances, were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were up 13% year on year, primarily due to higher legal expenses related to the resolution of matters previously announced. But excluding this, expenses would have been up 4% year on year on volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $33 billion, positive across all channels, asset classes and regions. And this was true of the $92 billion for the full year as well. In liquidity, we saw net outflows of $36 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $104 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.7 trillion, up 17% and 18% year on year respectively were driven by net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 31% year on year and loans were up 15% as clients continue to increase our liquidity and look for investment opportunities. Now on to corporate on Page 11.




 Corporate reported net loss of $358 million. Revenue was the loss of approximately $250 million, relatively flat year on year. Net interest income was down $730 million on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities as well as limited deployment opportunity on the back of continued deposit growth. The declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately $540 million on several legacy equity investments. And expenses of $361 million were roughly flat year on year as well. Now shifting gears, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021, which I'll cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 12. As you can see on the page, we expect NII to be around $55.5 billion in 2021, and this is based on the latest implies, which reflects this deepening yield curve we've seen over the past few weeks. As you can see that we do expect to be able to more than offset the impact of low rates in 2021 from continued deposit growth and higher markets NII. But it's important to note that it takes the loan growth to truly realize the benefits of a steeper yield curve.I'll also just remind you that the increase in CIB markets NII is largely offset in NIR, and this component is highly market dependent. And so as it relates to loan growth, while there should be some opportunities in AWM in wholesale, we expect headwinds, at least in the near term as corporate cash balances are at all-time high, card payment rates are elevated and there continues to be significant prepayments in home lending. But we do expect these to normalize and see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year, particularly in cards. Therefore, our fourth quarter 2021 NII estimate of $14 billion or more is a reasonable exit rate. And notably, that's in the zipcode of our 4Q '19 NII when rates were significantly higher than they are today. We've also included on the right side of page some risks and opportunities, and obviously, this isn't an exhaustive list, but are the drivers that could be most impactful to this year's NII outlook. Now turning to expenses on Page 13. As Jamie mentioned last month, we do expect our expenses to increase in 2021.




 And based on our latest work, we expect that number to be around $68 billion, up versus the prior guidance of $67 billion, largely due to higher volume and revenue-related expenses and the impact of FX, both of which have offsets in the revenue line as well as the impact of expenses from our recent acquisition of cxLoyalty. Then taking a look at the year-over-year expense growth, you can see it's primarily due to investments, which I'll cover in more detail on the next page. Our volume and revenue-related expenses are up slightly with some puts and takes there. That's obviously market dependent, but remember, any changes there do come with corresponding changes to our top-line. And in structural, we expect a net reduction of approximately $200 million. Notably, this includes a decrease of $500 million, reflecting the realization of continued cost efficiencies and what largely our fixed cost base. And you can see that it is partially offset by the impact of FX on our non-U.S. dollar expenses. It's important to note that while structural is coming down, it doesn't represent the full extent of our productivity, we're realizing efficiencies in each category here. For example, our software engineers are becoming more productive and we are reducing our cost to serve as we're seeing more customers use our digital tools to self-serve. Moving to Page 14 to take a closer look at our investment spend. Over the past few years, our investment spend has been around $10 billion and we expect that to increase to nearly $12.5 billion in 2021. You can see that we've highlighted on the page the major areas of focus that we've been consistently investing in for years, which should continue to strengthen our franchise and drive revenue growth. Starting on the bottom with technology, this represents roughly half of the overall investment spend. And these tech investments are across the board as we look to better meet our customer and client needs, improve our customers' digital experience, strengthen our fraud detection capabilities as well as modernize and improve our technology infrastructure cloud and data capabilities. Moving to nontech investments.




 We expect marketing spend, largely CCB, to return to pre-COVID levels this year after being down in 2020. We continue to invest in our distribution capabilities across all of our businesses. This includes hiring bankers and advisors, not only in U.S., but also internationally as well as expanding our physical footprint. We've been continuing to execute against our branch expansion plans in new markets, having opened 170 branches so far out of our planned 400, and expect to be in all contiguous 48 states by new 2021. Jamie is laughing. And the other bucket on the page is a catchall for everything else, including real estate and other various investments across our businesses. These expenses were very stable the past few years and the increase in 2021 is largely related to our $30 billion commitment to the path forward, which includes promoting affordable housing, expanding homeownership for underserved communities and supporting minority-owned businesses, and then as well as expenses related to our acquisition of cxLoyalty. So in summary, you can see that we continue to invest through the cycle. And it's these investments that we believe position us well to outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment. Now I will turn to a few balance sheet and capital-related topics, starting on Page 15. Over the next few slides, I'd like to provide you some insight on how recent monetary expansion and corresponding growth in the financial system is creating new challenges for bank balance sheet. More specifically, this expansion is putting significant pressure on size-based capital requirements, which is likely to impact business decisions, including capital targets.We'll start with what has happened this year. In response to the COVID crisis, the Fed's balance sheet has significantly expanded, which has resulted in $3 trillion of domestic deposit growth across the U.S. commercial banks. What's important to note is that this QE is unlike anything we've seen before. In the current QE, we have experienced a much bigger and faster expansion.




 And that expansion has come without meaningful loan demand beyond PPP, as you can see in the loan-to-deposit ratio on the page. This has resulted in bank balance sheets, which are larger, but more liquid and less risky.From a bank capital perspective, the key question to ask is, how long will this persist. On the chart, you can see that the QE3 online kept the Fed on pause for several years before a modest pace of reductions. So even if the Fed immediately signals tapering, which of course is not the base case and follows the pace of the last online, it will take many years to return to pre-COVID levels. Of course, the online speed [Inaudible], but I think we can all agree that bank balance sheets will remain elevated for some time. Now let's go to Page 16 and see how this will impact capital going forward. Few factors that are top of mind for us are GSIB, which we've been talking about for a long time, and also SLR which is not something we typically talk about, but given the overall system expansion is now on focus. On the graph, what you can see here are the historical trends of GSIB and SLR base requirements, overlaid with the path of the Fed securities holdings. You can see that during the original calibration of these rules, which included significant gold plating, the Fed balance sheet was notably lower. With the recent growth in the Fed balance sheet, we are seeing upward pressure in increases to GSIB requirements as well as the SLR shifting from a backstop to a binding measure, which will impact the pace of capital return, and these dynamics will likely persist for an extended period. The Fed temporary relief of SLR expires after March 31. This adjustment for cash and treasuries should either be made permanent or at a minimum be extended. With these exclusions, you can see how this remains a backstop measure, not a binding one. And on GSIB, there has been public dialog about the need to index the score to GDP as a proxy to account for ordinary economic expansion over time. And this was also cited by the Fed as a possible shortcoming of their framework. For 2020, GDP was clearly not the best proxy for system expansion but the principle still applies.




 GSIB was designed as a relative measure between large and medium-sized banks. And therefore, it certainly reflects an overall system expansion, which impacted small, medium and large banks alike. By future-proofing GSIB at inception with the adjustments outlined on the page, you can see the resulting GSIB score profile, lowered over time, but more importantly, flatter over the course of the most recent system expansion. While we recognize that prudent bank capital requirements do promote safety and soundness, satisfying these heightened requirements is certainly not costless which is why these two areas, GSIB and leverage are top of mind for us in 2021. Now let's look at the impact of this on marginal deposits on Page 17. In addition to what we've already discussed, there are two more building blocks required to see the full picture of marginal deposit economics, and they are interest rates and loan demand. We've experienced a combination of both lower interest rates and lower loan demand, which have reduced the NIM of marginal deposits to practically zero, which you can see here on the chart. And this is an issue for all banks, not just GSIBs or JPMorgan. However, what is specific to the larger banks is that when the SLR becomes binding, we may be required to issue new debt and retain higher equity, which ultimately makes the marginal deposit a negative ROE proposition in today's ultra-low rate environment. The key test and question is, what could happen next? We could simply shy away from taking new deposits, redirecting them elsewhere in the system or we can issue or retain additional capital and pass on some of their costs, which is certainly something we wouldn't want to do in this environment. And therefore, we strongly encourage a serious look to these sized-based capital calibrations with an appropriate sense of urgency as we will soon be facing this critical business decision. All of this can be addressed through a few simple adjustments, namely, an extension of the SLR exclusion and GSIB fixed as we've spoken about overtime. But to be clear, we believe the framework as a whole has made the banking system safer as we experienced in 2020. But we're also seeing evidence where the lack of coherence and recalibration is risking unintended consequences going forward. With all that said, before I close things out on capital, here is how we're thinking about target CET1 levels. While GSIB pressure remains and the need for recalibration is high, our SCB optimization can provide some offset, allowing us to manage to a 12% CET1 target.




 The recent stress test showed an implied 20 basis point reduction to SCB, and we have continued our optimization efforts since the resubmission. So we're hopeful for a lower SCB later this year, of course, that's scenario dependents. At this point, it's too early to provide specific color on the impact of SLR, so it's just important to know that in the absence of any adjustments to the measure, we may have to issue preferreds or carry additional fee if you want over the 12% target I just mentioned. We obviously can't emphasize these key messages enough and these factors are clearly front and center as we think about managing our balance sheet and capital targets in the near and medium term. Now before we conclude, note that we've included a few additional slides on our businesses and the intent is to give you an update on their strategic highlights our performance as well as provide the latest financial outlook. The themes and initiatives we talked about at last year's Investor Day still remain our focus and we continue to execute and make progress against them.So to wrap up, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year, but it also showcased the benefits of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company, while our employees relentlessly focused on supporting our customers, clients, and communities. While downside risk do remain in the near term and it could be significant, several recent factors help us feel more optimistic as we look ahead to the recovery in the medium and longer term. So with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: OperatorCertainly. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jen. And happy New Year. Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Happy New Year, Steve.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst So, I want to start off with a question on the NII outlook. The 2021 guide implies rather a healthy step up versus the $54 billion. Jamie, you had reiterated just last month in your updated NII guide for '21. What are you assuming regarding the deployment of excess liquidity given some of the recent curves deepening? And separately, what are your assumptions around the trajectory for card balances and overall growth in '21, especially in light of the expectations for additional stimulus which we saw at least this past year could drive further consumer deleveraging?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, I'll start with excess liquidity. So, I think their -- the theme is we're being opportunistic or patient. So, as you think about the recent moves that we've seen in the yield curve, in the grand scheme of things, those could be small moves and, you know, as we think about managing the balance sheet it's not just about an eye, of course, it's about capital. And so there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further sell-off. So, we're -- we're being very patient but we have been and will continue to be optimistic and you will have seen that we did add $60 billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter. So, that's what we're assuming and the outlook is -- is, you know, a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity. And then -- Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 In the implied terms. Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. In the implied terms, yeah. And then on current balances, it is quite extraordinary what we're seeing in terms of payment rates in the current portfolio which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to be leveraged. So, there is an offset in the credit line but we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of 2021 as I spend recovers but that it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated. So, that's why everything listed on that page is a plus/minus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk. 




Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And just for my follow up, I wanted to ask on capital. Both the slides are really interesting highlighting the impact of QE on the leverage ratio and GSIB scores. You've been critical of GSIB surcharges and the need to recalibrate these coefficients for some time. We haven't really seen much progress there. It kind of feels like waiting for Godot as if the Fed is slow to recalibrate the minimum leverage ratios to account for this QE-driven deposit growth. What mitigating actions can you take to ensure you're not capital-constrained as balance sheet growth continues and maybe any revenue attrition we need to contemplate as part of those mitigating actions?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So -- so, I'll -- I'll start with GSIB if we take that in turn. So, starting with GSIB, as I said, we do think that we have opportunity in the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent and based on the Fed models. But we do think we have opportunity there based on the work that we've been doing. So, it will be very difficult for us to get back to 3.5% with the current expansion. So, we are expecting to remain in the 4% bucket but as you know that's not effective until early 2023. So that gives us time to manage SCB as I mentioned as an offset. On -- on the leverage issues, we have, you know, we can cure this through issuing preferred but we haven't made that decision yet, as I said, because it is -- it is a -- it is a critical decision for us to think about. And as you think about capital return, it would depend on where our stock prices as we think about the economic value of issuing preferred to buy back stocks. So, there is a lot for us to think about over the next couple of months.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Because you said the G-SIFI because it's very important. If we were on the international standard, our G-SIFI would be 2%, not 4%. And we have been talking about they were supposed to adjust GSIB before the growth of the economy and effectively the shrinking size of the banking system. Because the banking system itself is getting smaller as mortgages go to the nonbanks and private credit goes elsewhere, and the rest of the international, Chinese banks are growing, etc. So, these adjustments should be made. We pointed out as $1.3 trillion of liquid assets and marketable securities on a balance sheet, which shockingly reached G-SIFI 2. G-SIFI has no risk weighted measurements to it, no diversification to it, no profitability to it. It just kind of these very gross measures and it needs to be recalibrated and same with SLR. I mean, so do we expect it to happen? Probably not in our lifetimes, because we have politicized bank -- detailed bank numbers and so on, and we can live with it for now. But in the long run, it's not good for Americans, that much of a disadvantage to our competitors overseas.Operator




Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst




 Sorry. Sorry. Hi. Sorry, let me mute for a second there. Maybe just talking about loan growth. You saw a pretty nice improvement in the wholesale side. You talked about some opportunities in '21. It seems to be mostly coming out of the CIB. Is that sort of acquisition finance? What's -- what's driving some of the improvement on the wholesale side?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah, I would say acquisition financing is the -- is the opportunity on the wholesale side. You know, when we -- when we, you know, there may be some opportunity in the back half of 2021 in C&I that -- that I feel like it's returning to BAU but I think that's going to take some time. But as I said, we are at historic levels of cash on corporate balance sheet then so, outside of acquisition financing and -- and C&I. It -- it will be challenging. C&I in the back half of 2021.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then maybe on your expense assumptions for the $68 billion, you don't really mention at all any of the CIB. You would think that if -- if we are, as everyone assumes, you know, we had a record year in 2020, 2021 maybe markets and IB fees are lower.




 Is there any kind of -- are you building in some lower comp -- you know, revenue-based compensation expense in -- in that $68 billion or is that potential a positive? Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, we capture that in the volume and revenue related, Jim. It just happens to be more than offset by volume and revenue-related growth elsewhere.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I just point out the $68 billion. We don't make commitments or promises, so that $68 billion, I would love to find $2 billion more of investments, literally. I mean, we are seeking every year find more to do to help clients around the world and stuff like that. So that's kind of our current forecast. And fortunately, we found some more to do, including cxLoyalty and opening more branches and some of the technology we are building, et cetera. But I'd like to find more. It would be the best and possible highest use of our capital.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, John.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi, Jen. Given the outlook for net interest income and expenses, it seems like the efficiency ratio is going to tick up a few 100 basis points this year '21 versus '20. And I know you don't manage it necessarily year to year but just kind of overtime you seem to have a mid 50s efficiency target. Just kind of wondering how you put guardrails up for yourselves in terms of expense discipline and managing overtime to have positive operating leverage and an efficiency quarter. 




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, I'll -- I'll start by saying you're absolutely right that we don't manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter or even any year, and the operating leverage is very important to us. And then we -- we gave a share in Investor Day at about a 55% efficiency ratio. I'll say, in a normalized environment, we haven't had anything that structurally has changed. And so, that should still be achievable for us in a normalized-rate environment and otherwise normalized environment. And then, as it relates to expense discipline you know it -- it is a bottoms-up process. And so, everywhere around this company, we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that which is why I call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that is in investments or volume and revenue related it isn't necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiencies.So the discipline is everywhere and it's -- it's the way we run the company and we do believe in -- in the importance of operating leverage through time, no doubt.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




  OK. And then as a follow up on the NII walk, you've got a billion-dollar incremental NII expected in '21 versus '20 for markets -- CIB markets. Can that be true if market's revenues are down year over year? You know, can they both be true and just maybe explain that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, it can be -- it can absolutely be true. So the market is -- I mean, in most of our businesses, we don't run them NII versus noninterest revenue it -- it is an accounting construct about markets. It's particularly true. So yes, that is -- that is possible. In NII, the market business you can think about is -- is liability sensitive. So you know, you're going to see the benefit of lower rates in NII. That doesn't necessarily imply anything about the overall performance.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We have a positive carry. In trading, profit goes down and the carry goes up. But not -- the absolute numbers are the same.OperatorYour next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. 




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Hi, good morning. My first question is on the outlook for card losses. The 2.17% net charge-off rate was certainly eye-opening relative to, you know, what happened in 2020 and the discussions actually that I've been having with investors on the trajectory of card is, you know, do -- do you think that the bridge that the government built is strong enough that we may not see, you know, a spike in losses in card like we're all expecting? And Jen, given your comments earlier, what would you need to see to feel more comfortable about releasing reserves from your card portfolio? 




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, it's interesting that you -- you brought up the bridge being strong enough. It does feel like at this point in this crisis, the -- the bridge has been strong enough. The question that still remains is is the bridge long enough. And so, while we just had a recent stimulus pass, that makes us feel better about the bridge being long enough. But we have to get through the next three months to six months. So, it feels like we have been saying that since this crisis started but I think it is particularly true at this point, obviously, given the vaccine rollout. So, you know, consumer confidence is still low relative to pre-COVID levels. You can converse that with -- compare that to the wholesale side, we are seeing confidence is up. That's not true on the consumer side. And so the next three months to six months is going to be critically important for us to assess whether or not only is it strong enough, but is it long enough, and do you see consumer sentiment pick up a bit.There's also possibility for payment shops as some, you know, relief programs, whether it be a student loan, forbearance or tax -- taxes owed on benefits received. There are things that could hit the consumer in the next three months to six months that we need to think about.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right. I would just add, very different for subprime and prime. And if you look at our portfolio, it's mostly prime. And the -- the folks in the prime category have a lot more income, a lot more savings, housing prices are up. They did not lose their jobs but the news there is actually rather good. On the lower quartiles, it's the opposite. Even now when we just did all the stimulus checks and we did about $12 million of them which have already been processed --Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 $12 billion.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer $12 million. $12 billion, $12 million for $12 billion approximately. And there's the bottom but the -- the folks who had $1,000 in their accounts, where the accounts are coming down and they just got $1,000, they obviously needed. The folks in the higher end, they obviously don't need quite as much. So, it's positive -- we expected to go up but it's possible somehow that doesn't happen in some dramatic way. 




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. And -- and Jamie, my second question is for you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'd say, we are making this point very important.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We do not consider taking down reserves recurring or low income. We don't do show across. We don't consider a profit. It's -- it's ink on paper.




 It's based upon lots of different calculations. Obviously, we want real loss to be lower over time. But I would just -- if you -- if our card reserves like $17 billion, we took it down next quarter because we have more optimistic outlooks, we are not going to be sitting here cheering about that, we are cheering that market is doing better. But we don't want to consider those earnings. And I think you all should look at a little bit differently now, particularly with the change in accounting rules.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah. I think -- I think your investors appreciate that. And the second question I had for you, Jamie is, you know, in last -- on last year's Investor Day, it was clear to your investor base that you were looking to inorganically enhance your scale in AWM. And what interesting is that the discussion that I have been having with your investors more recently is them wondering whether or not you would consider a larger deal maybe in payments, you know, given that a lot of investors and banks are thinking that that's the, you know, the part that seems to be potentially more vulnerable to technology competitors.




 What are your thoughts there? And I guess, my -- my own thought process has been tempered by Jennifer's presentation on capital, but we wanted to get your thoughts there.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Again, we have -- I mean, our capital cup runneth over, OK. We have so much capital we cannot use it. If you look at what happened this year, our capital went from 12.4% to 13.3%. And by -- I think advanced is more representative of real risks so it will be 13.8%. That's after doing $2 trillion of loans, $12 trillion of reserves, $12 trillion -- $12 billion of reserved, $12 billion of dividend. I mean, we are earning -- if you look at pre-tax -- pre-provision $45 billion or $50 billion a year. So we're -- we're in very good shape to invest.The most important thing we said to management, we say that we grow that every business organically, every single one opening branches and accounts, doing payments, and we put a lot of time and effort in payments. We are quite good at it between credit card, debit card, Chase merchant services.




 But I agree with you and -- but we are open for inorganic too. Inorganic shouldn't be an excuse not for growing organically and -- and it's not just Chase, it's not just asset management, it will be an area where we could do that. I don't think cxLoyalty was neat thing, is [Inaudible] neat thing, we bought 55 IP, which is a special way to manage money, tax efficiently. And so we are going to build it ourselves or buy it. We are open-minded. Anyone you have good ideas for us, let us know. We have the wherewithal, but we thought we will also look at buying it. Like I said, we are always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently. We have got a tremendous set of assets. We also have a tremendous debt of competitors, particularly in payments, consumer land now, and a bunch of other areas. So you saw Google Pay. You saw Wal-mart is going to try to spend a bit more time is expanding. And we -- we like competition, we believe in it. But we have to be really prepared for that and that is deeply on our mind and how we run our business.




OperatorYour next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Betsy.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Jamie, a question on cxLoyalty, because I thought your loyalty program and -- and capability set there in your payment space and your consumer-facing space was quite good. So, I am just wondering what the rationale was? And is there an expectation that you are going to be leveraging that into non, you know, card portions of your business, was that part of the -- so what was this deal?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, Betsy, I will take that one. So this -- this -- we are really excited about this one. And really with any tech platform, scale matters. So, combining our scale with cxLoyalty's innovative technology will be a win not only for our Chase customers but for cxLoyalty's existing clients and suppliers.




 And then -- and then you're right to point out our existing UR platform, but that today is predominantly used as a point production portal. So there's a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of our customer spend on travel which is $140 billion both on and off us. So in addition to capturing the full economic value of the existing redemptions on the platform, we also have an opportunity to really turn it into a great place for our customers to book travel.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. But still focused on the card space as opposed to moving into, you know, other parts of your relationship with consumers?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 It's -- it's -- it's con -- it's consumer, this thing it was consumer.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst [Inaudible]Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 That's not what you said, it has to be card only. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jen, mentioned the number, like more than 30% of travel expense goes through our cards, something like that. And -- and so, we want to give a far better experience to our own customers when it comes to what we offer them to travel. You are right, ultimate reward always does a good job but why would you try to double that overtime or triple it?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 And we think we can -- we can -- we can do a better job for their existing clients and suppliers. So, it won't just be about Chase customers.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Exactly.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 OK. And then the follow-up question just on the technology budget increasing, I mean, I know this comes after a year of being somewhat stable year on year. And just wanted to dig into the comment you made on the -- on the page around data analytics, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence capabilities. Again, you have been a leader in this for a while. So you know, the question is what -- where's the whitespace that you are moving into? And can you give us a sense as to how important this is for some of the expansion that you are doing geographically in, you know, U.K. digital and some of the European footprint that you are expanding into?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So -- so first of all, cyber we are going to do -- we have to do whatever it takes and we are going to do that in -- in everything we do. But you mentioned, we built a brand new data centers pretty much around the world, which are a lot more efficient. They are going to be effectively -- they're not cloud base but they have all the cloud technology, etc, for our own private cloud. When we move other stuff to the public cloud, we are refactoring applications to get there, where we are doing all the data, you all know the issue with data, not that banks were bad, but data was held in all these different accounts, you are trying to build these data links, you can use AI and machine learning better and it all do haste.The cloud is real.




 The cost is real. The speed is real. The security is real. The AI is real. The machine learning is real. So every single business and with every single meeting we go through is talking about what are we moving to the cloud, whether it's internal or external? What are we adding AI machinery on? Are we getting the data analytics right and it is global. It's -- and we don't spend that much time on it. But every single business is doing it. You have a tremendous amount of AI being used in -- in asset wealth management, CIB, in trading, in commercial banking prospecting, and it's literally the tip of the iceberg. Whatever we say today, 10 years from now, it will be probably 50 times more than we are doing today. And I would spend anything to get it done faster.Operator




Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Ken.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on -- on capital return and capital usage. In the deck and in your press release, you mentioned that you are looking to get back into more return of capital, you mentioned $4.5 billion net and there's still the net income test. And I just wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through how you think about, you know, full -- you know, how do you think about full usage of that $4.5 billion and then how do you think forward vis-à-vis the comments we just talked about with regards to potential external opportunities and what's the best use of that incremental capital, given that you still have, you know, a healthy amount sitting there?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So -- so, we always start in the same place, which is we would much prefer to do the things that Jamie's been talking about when to buy back our stocks. So, we would much prefer to deploy it to organic growth or -- or acquisitions. Having said that, we do as you point out have significant excess capital at this point.




 When we look at the first quarter, the -- the Fed capacity was defined by the trailing four quarters of profits and so when you back out our dividend, that's where you get to the $4.5 billion. So that is the, you know, capacity that we have for this quarter and we will do up to that amount, obviously. I don't know that we will do the full amount, but we'll -- we'll certainly do, obviously, can't do more than $4.5 billion. And then we -- we, you know, we are certainly hopeful that we can go back to the EU under the SCB framework beyond the first quarter as we think about buybacks. But -- but we will wait to see what the Fed says at the end of the first quarter.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer If you can manage your capital down to the 12% or whatever we said, with that regards have been getting permission from the Fed. They have already implied that's what they can do. That's the way it should be done eventually one day.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yep. Understood.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I want to point out is that, we have been consistent in 2 times tangible book, but our earnings power and dividend and all stuff like that, it still makes sense to buy back stock. But that diminishes, you know, every point, 2.1 or 2.2, or 2.3, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically or inorganically. Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, we will always look at the effective return of us buying back our stock for our remaining shareholders and if we think it makes sense relative to the alternative we are going to keep doing it.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yep. Consistent with what you have said in the past. Thanks. And just a question on the card business, you mentioned how much of that spend goes through Chase, and just you are -- given that we still have some uncertainties with regards to a true return to open. Yeah, your card segment revenue yield actually did improve a little bit. I am just wondering if you can kind of help us, just think through, just the pushes and pulls you see on the card business with regards to your expectations of -- of spend improving, balances improving, and -- and competition underneath? Thanks.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. So, the competition remains very, very strong. As it relates to the revenue yield, it's a little bit of noise there, because balances are down so much and that's what that's derived from. So there's a little bit of noise there. Importantly, you know, we -- we -- we do -- if GDP is back to 2019 levels by the middle of the year, we expect them to continue to recover, and perhaps, significantly, so in the second half. As it relates to travel, whether it's the second half of '21 or '22, we -- we are confident that our -- our customers will continue to travel and there's pent-up demand onshore for travel and so we are excited about those opportunities, whether they come, you know, in '21 or '22 or beyond. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we take very seriously the new entrance like the Goldman Sachs card and there are a bunch of other folks who are doing similar things that we expect to see more of that.




OperatorYour next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Glenn.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hello, there. Thank you. So, I think it's good time of the year to get your mark-to-market on, your thoughts on the competitive landscape and I know every business is competitive. But I'm -- I'm more curious on the new side of competitive and maybe I am talking more about the consumer and commercial banking right now. But between all the neo banks that either want to pay much more than you guys on deposits or charge no fees, or the pay -- buy now pay later models, or things where you also even play in banking as a service in trying to provide banking products to big technology companies with big client footprints. I am most curious to see, is this just normal evolution and not changing things or -- or is there something bigger going on here that you -- you want to comment on? Thanks.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah. So I am going to -- in the commercial bank, it is probably less than you think. I do think there are alternative credit providers. But we will just do a lot of things for our clients, they can quit investment banking, FX swaps, cash management custody, asset management, etc. So it's slightly different. I got a consumer saw me and we wrote in the chairman's letter years ago that Silicon Valley is coming. And I think it's just more and faster and better and quicker. And we have to just be very conscious that includes pay now, pay later and we have some of the products ourselves, but our job is to make sure we use our unbelievable strength and client base and capability and Gordon always points out, when you have that kind of products that goes to keep it simple, clear, basic, what the customer wants, to just to deliver more and better and so we are quite conscious.And I would also add, by the way, it's not just that, you know, we've -- the team looks at and financial and early pay and -- and all these other competitors. I expect one day, you can see other big foreign banks back here again, including the big Chinese banks, the biggest ones were bigger than us. And you know, I'm -- that may be five years or 10 years out, but we better be thinking five years or 10 years out. And so they are all coming, we were comfortable, but you know, we're -- we're still exercising and taking our -- taking out vitamins, OK?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 And it's another reason our -- our investments are going up as much, yeah, because we are very well aware of it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Fair enough. Keep taking those vitamins. Maybe along the same lines, I think, you -- you spoke -- spoken about the power that the data of your own client footprints and -- and -- and franchises have. I am just curious, we haven't heard that much lately about what you are collecting, how you can use it, how you can use it to enhance the customer experience accelerate growth. You -- you have all this at your fingertips and people talk about data as being the new gold. I'm -- I'm curious on how you are thinking about it right now?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, yes, and yes. That's all we are going to tell you. I mean, I have talked about how important AI is, obviously, the data in that. The AI and data are directly related and some of it gets used very well. But if you shut down, some of it doesn't get used well. We have restrictions, you know, far more restrictions than some of our Silicon Valley competitors. But still, there are ways to use our data to do a better job for our clients. And we do a tremendous amount already in marketing, risk, fraud, cyber, you name it. And we use a lot of that -- like a lot of that stuff also protects our clients in cyber.




OperatorYour next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. I will ask my question -- I'll ask my question and go back in the queue. Just -- I guess I -- I miss your Investor Day. We have four slides to -- to talk about that.




 I guess, if your capital cup runneth us over, maybe your expense budget could run us over too. I mean, spending is certain, returns are uncertain. So, seems like there's more questions this year than in the past. You did get positive off the leverage last year during the pandemic. So, yes, you have earned the right to go ahead and spend more. I think most people would agree. But there's still just so many questions, so I will just ask on CCB. It looks like Slide 16. You mentioned going to all 48 states by mid-2021. I didn't really get all of that. So, what -- how many states have you been in and by the time you get to 48, how much spending is that? What's the game plan? What's your plan with branches? Others are shutting branches after the pandemic, you are expanding. If you could just give some color on that or if Gordon's on the call, we can hear from him too?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Gordon -- Gordon's not but -- so you know, we've -- we started this a while back to expand the branches and stuff like that. We are still -- we are closing plenty of branches. So if you look at what we are doing, we got the number of leads, we have closed like 1,000 the last four years or five years and we have opened like 1,000 or something like that. But -- and I think we did the Bank One JPMorgan deal, we were in 21 states, 23 states. And when we started the expansion originally, you know, the -- we -- we're very conscious that the world needs less branches and the shape of the branches differently and you made hub and spoke and we are always testing new things and stuff like that. But we still have almost a million people today who visit branches and it's down, but it's a million people a day, I forgot the number, it's 60% or 70% accounts still open in branches, small businesses still need branches. And the new branches that we opened in Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., they -- they have been doing quite well. And the shocking thing is doing quite well in card, consumer, investments, small business. So as we go to all the other states, we just want to be and we know we have to have certain size, not going in each state with one just to plant the flag. That would be a kind of waste of time. We look at the major markets, number of people already know us through Chase, and stuff like that. And so we are optimistic that the strategy will pay off and it will enhance our businesses and our capabilities and -- and other things, I am not going to tell you because it's very competitive. I think we have shared too much with our competitors in the past. So I am going to kind of shut myself up a little bit.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer No. But, Mike, I can just add a -- a little bit of color on the numbers. So we -- we had said that we were going to open up 400 new branches in market expansion. So we have done 170 So far. Importantly, in 2020, we did fewer than 90, and in 2021 we are going to do 150. And so, of course, we, you know, by 2022 or 2023, that's going to start to sunset. So there are in the numbers multiyear investments that, you know, will -- they are ramping maybe in '21, but they will ramp down now that obviously gives us the capacity to reinvest those dollars. But you know, we -- we have a lot of capacity within the numbers you see on the page to continue to increase investments without necessarily the absolute number going up. In tech as an example, 10% or 20% of that number in any given year is completed. So that gives us more dollars to reinvest. And then the only thing I'd add on branches is this like the franchise value that comes with opening up these branches in new states is extraordinary and I think underestimated because it gives us the ability to do state and municipal business that we wouldn't have otherwise been able to do. So it's not -- it's not just about consumer banking.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And it gives me a chance to North Dakota, which is the only state I have never been in. But believe it or not, we already do a lot of middle market, credit card more in North Dakota. We just didn't do consumer banking. So, I do the second where I am allowed, I am on my way to like Bismarck or Fargo or something like -- [Inaudible]. The new head -- the new head of investor relations who is sitting in this room right now, Reggie Chambers, who I am sure you will get to know. This was part of what he did for the Sun Belt, which is the all branch expansion, though we don't really restrict them how much you can tell you. But -- but -- and including looking at different formats. We are not blind to the nature that you have the world changing and digital all that. So -- and we can very quickly, just so you know, I forgot the number, change the fleet, like if you said, you have got the world changing more rapidly, we are completely comfortable that in a five-year period, you can dramatically reduce the size of the fleet or the cost of the fleet, etc, while serving clients. 




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. So this is kind of like what you did with commercial bank few years back going to every state, I guess. But -- so 48 states, where were you, say, a year ago or three years ago, just to give final context to that?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 48 states three years ago. I mean, by the way, commercial bank, same thing. We talked about expansion. So we bought WaMu, you know, it took years, but we said we are going to do $1 billion in the WaMu states, which is mostly California, Florida, Atlanta.




 So we got -- what we are very close to hitting that. I thought governor was like $908 million this year or something like that. I told the teams we reviewed it yesterday that when we hit $1 billion, I want to send a case of really expensive wine to a guy called, Steve Walker, who did it for us and have great -- and we told him, right, like great bankers, great capabilities, stuff like that. We were doing $400 million of investment banking business when we did the Bank One deal JPMorgan through the commercial bank. We set a target of $1 billion and $2 billion and $3 billion, we exceeded $3 billion. I think we did $3.5 billion. The new target is $4 billion. It's now 25% to 30% of domestic U.S. investment banking, which DCM, ECM, M&A through that network and the investment bank -- the commercial bank expanded into healthcare, technology and we have a couple of other areas we are going to be rolling out soon. So these expansions really make sense. They pay for themselves. They are relentless. They are hard to do. They are obviously right?




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. I'll -- I'll requeue.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And remember the commercial -- the commercial bank generally these branches. It's very hard to judge -- and we have done it. But it's very hard to build a quality business without retail branches when you are a commercial bank. But you will see very few commercial banks that don't have retail branches.




OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Brian.




Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the expense outlook. I noticed there was a small piece in there related to the workforce optimization, but I guess thinking in the broader context, as we get through COVID-19 and move to the post-COVID-19 world, the general thought process was that there would be this big expense save opportunity coming from that, work-from-home environment. But it doesn't really show in your expense outlook. Is it something that, you know, expect to see beyond 2021? Is this a, you know --Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst Step down expenses?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 But-but in the big picture there are people expenses $33 billion, for real estate expenses, I am going to say $3 billion.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 So, yeah, even -- and I do think it can be much more efficient than that, but I don't think it's like a -- a -- a game changer.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And we can't move our footprint that quickly, anyway. So, we do -- we do have time here to make sure that we do it really thoughtfully.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 But Jen is thinking about moving the finance function to Florida.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hawaii. Yes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Hawaii.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hawaii, that's right.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst




 And then just a follow up, but maybe on the international, I saw still the billion hopes of additional revenue on the international. Just give an update on how that's tracking so far?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sorry, sorry, I didn't catch that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 The billion what?Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst On the international revenue expansion that you were looking for?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Oh. The -- firstly, that's some banking expanding globally everywhere as best we can and so as asset management. And because we already spoke about China and stuff like that, the commercial banks started an international expansion effort to cover companies overseas that we do business with here that we are not covering and it's doing fine. It's mostly expense right now. You know, we added bankers and products and services and legal and compliance and we didn't add -- we have been adding clients as we were quite happy with it. I should point out that we just had the best year ever in Asia. I mean, I think, it was up like 20% or something like that. So -- and you know, Asia is still will be one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. So our -- you know -- and that's kind of country by country to make sure we get that right. Operator




Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Jamie. Can you guys share with us, obviously, there's been a change in the administration in the Senate and a number of our regulatory body heads are going to be replaced this year, including the FCC and the Consumer Protection Bureau. Can you guys give us some color what you are thinking about what may change from a regulatory standpoint with the different political party controlling Washington now?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, our focus is always the same. We have got -- we have got 60 million U.S. clients. We have got 6,000 investment clients around the world. We have got -- we run this company to serve clients, communities, hospitals. We financed $100 billion in states, cities, schools, hospitals each year. That's what we do.




 And obviously, we want to satisfy all of our regulators. So I do expect that there will be a new set of regulators. We will have a new set of demands. Some we agree with. We want to do a better job in climate for the world. We want to be more green. We want to help the disadvantaged. We rolled out an enormous amount of progress in racial equality and things like that. So, yeah, but they will be tougher. That's -- that's life. It's life around the world. We are going to -- we have to do a whole bunch of new regulators, which we are trying to satisfy in the ECB, etc. And so, it's -- I don't need to change our life that much and competitively, everyone's in the same kind of boat and, you know, so it -- it will be fine. And we -- we want the new president to be successful.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst And then following up, Jennifer, you talked about on Page 17 of your slide deck, the -- the issue with deposits and the marginal benefit of these deposits and you guys are, you know, wrestling with this issue? Can you share with us, yeah, and you already have talked about the, you know, the branch expansion in all 48 states could save U.S. states? How is this going to be managed as best you can over the next 12 months to 24 months, because obviously, long term, you want that branch expansion, but simultaneously, as you have pointed out, you -- you may be getting a negative ROI, if you don't get relief on the SLR? And is there a chance that you will get that extension on the SLR from the regulators?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, I will start with -- we -- we certainly remain hopeful that we will get the extension. Importantly, as we think about branch expansion near-term rate headwinds, we certainly consider that, but at the margin there, not a factor given the long-term franchise value associated with the branch expansion and -- and the fact that it's not just about deposits for any one consumer anyway, because we have the opportunity to have a much broader relationship with them and all of that is factored into the branch expansion. But we do consider in -- in the analytics there the near-term headwinds from -- from rates. But -- but there is a steady-state number which is more of a normalized level of rates.




 So it doesn't --  it doesn't -- at a margin it might change some decisions around marketing, but it -- it doesn't have a big impact on us.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. The bigger decisions on that which we have a lot of leeway on is out of the investment bank. It's repo, deposits, corporate clients, trade finance, all those other things. So the -- this is managed very, very closely. Remember GSIB uses one of, say, 20 constraints we managed by business, by product, by area, by region, by --




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And we -- and bring it up, obviously, it is an issue for us in the near to medium term, should we not get the extension and it's one that's important for people to understand. But we bring it up more so because it should, another example of, you know, where lack of coherence around these rules can have an impact, not just on JPMorgan. So we don't bring it up just because of the impact on JPMorgan. We bring it up because it is perhaps one of the better examples of the need for recalibration. You have to have the right incentives in the system for it to work through time and we are just seeing that's not the case.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 So we don't want to do it, it is very customer friendly and say, could you take your deposits elsewhere, but --Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Right.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 They do have -- a lot of this larger corporate client who have other options and bunch of deposits, but money market funds or something like that. So, we are mad. It is not -- none of this is going to be an issue for 2021, folks. I mean, fundamentally, it is just how we were a company. And even -- even if that temporary relief goes away. And I am always against temporary relief, because for this exact reason, it creates another cliff, even if it goes away we are fine, we just have to manage it much tighter.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi. Maybe a bit of a basic question, but why is markets revenue are trading so good still, not just for you, but the overall wallet? You know, I get it to be investment banking business, the feeder businesses still very good, there's lots of liquidity, banks have lots of capital, but of course, rates are near zero, budget tight, volatility is low. I will take away some of the answers. But you know, just conceptually it's been very strong.




 It sounds like the hope is it will remain strong. What's really driving it?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There is $350 billion of global financial assets, $50 trillion -- $350 trillion, and probably, in 10 years or 20 years that number is going to be $700 trillion. People have to buy and sell to hedge, finance, with money around the world, FX, currencies, our pension plans. You know, obviously, volumes go up and down. You know, spreads generally over time has been coming down, what you would expect in a competitive market. So -- but -- but the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks around the world that Jen showed you, the $3 trillion or $4 trillion in the Fed, but globally it is $12 trillion. And you know, companies have a lot of financing to do. And -- and of course, when you have higher DCM and higher ECM and higher M&A that also drives a lot of trading and so you got to kind of put that all in the mix.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And obviously, the question is how sustainable is this, and I guess, one argument could be that technology has allowed banks to increase the velocity. You can talk about this for some time. Do you think that is a structural change that will benefit the businesses and specifically for you guys over a long-term time period?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. The way we look is we kept our share of what things we are trying to find digitized and the business has done a kind of the way we expected them to do it. So, yeah, we think scale matters, technology matters, and hopefully, we think we can even grow our share. This is just trench warfare.




 So we expect to grow it, but we, you know, I don't -- it's a very hard to say what the base level is and we thought that the base level kind of revise down sometime last year, but will stay as high as it stayed in 2020 then I doubt. It may not go back to what it was. It may be higher than that. OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hi, Charles.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst Good morning. I have a couple of questions related to fintech and unfortunately, I was born in a wrong generation, so I need a lot of help. How dependent is the fintech world on the banking system, as I understand they lay on top of the pipes in the plumbing of the banking system. Do you have any leverage in a competitive world against the fintech world? And -- and then, secondly, I noticed that the OCC gave banks the green light to use public blockchain networks and stable points. Can you explain how -- what important that has to JPMorgan?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You go ahead with blockchain there.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, OK, sure. So -- so that -- that guidance enables an offering of stable going on a public blockchain. So that doesn't impact JPM coin. JPM coin, you should think about as the tokenization of our customer deposits.




 So, it's obviously very early. We will assess use cases and -- and customers demand. But -- but it's still too early to see where this goes for us.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we are using blockchain for sharing data with banks already and so we are at the forefront of that which is good. The other question was about fintech. You know, look, first of all, they are very good competitors. And I pointed out to a lot of people, you know, PayPal were $250 million, Squares were done in $20 million, Stripe is worth $80 billion, Ant Financial is down quite a bit now. But they are there. They are strong. They are smart, some effectively ride the rails. So we bank a lot of them.




 You know, we help them accomplish what they want to accomplish and you have -- so my view is we are going to compete, we will need to and we have to look at our -- look inside about what we could do better or could have done better and things like that. So I am confident we will be able to compete. But I think we now are facing old generation of newer, tougher, faster competitors who -- and if they don't buy the rails of JPMorgan, they can buy rails of someone else. So you see, I have told you before, everyone is going to be involved in payments. Some banks going to white label, which makes -- which makes fintech competitors white label the bank and build every sort of thing on top of it and we have to be prepared for that. I expect it to be very, very tough competition in the next 10 years. I expect to win. So help me God. Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst Thanks. So did they need the banking system to complete their loop of -- of service or can they work completely outside the bank?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, the most will do for now, but I think it's a mistake because it's going to be forever. The game of bank licenses, Utah is giving industrial licenses. Like I said, banks are white labeling. So it's effectively the same thing. If you know, if fintech companies uses a white label bank just to process their business, they're -- they're basically a bank. You know, when -- what the regulator will do, I don't know, but we have to assume that they are going to do it. And that some don't need, we'll -- we'll find ways, not to use their banking system, which they have done. I mean, if you look at a whole bunch of the things they have used stuff around the banking system, which is fine, I am not against that. The regulators may have a point of view about that one day, but I am less worried about that. I am going to worry about us.




OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi Andrew.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi. Hi. Good morning. And so...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, Charles, one other point, if our examples unfair competition, which we will do something about eventually. People who we will make a lot more on debit, because they activate under certain things, the only reason they compete is because of that. People you know, basically, don't do KYC AML and create risk for the system. And I can go on and on, but that part we will be a little bit more aggressive on, people who improperly use data has been given to them by client, OK? So you can expect that there will be other battle to take place here.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi. Sorry. It's Andrew Lim here. So I just wanted to pick your brains on inflation and hopefully, inflation metrics are picking up. If we look at rates, if you look at the inflation indicators and that's like a lot of people are jumping on this replacement bandwagon. But I just wanted to see what you are seeing on the ground in the real world as to how this might be manifesting itself even in commercial banking or in investment banking in terms of like the month, products, or volatility. Is that something that you -- you see as a scene developing?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I mean, look, we don't have that much more insight than you do. You do see signs witnessing in commodities and certain products and consumer goods and stuff like that. It's hard to tell that, you know, supply lines that can't keep up with demand or you have long-term trends, China is no longer ending the world. That -- that can change inflation. I think and we looked at when Jen gave those numbers, she always using implied curve. I think the best way to think about it is, I think this should be a much bigger conversation next year because we have good growth. I think it's a good thing that we have good growth and part inflation, but that will become part of the conversation, how bad, what I am going to do and things like that. Just so the risk management thing, you got to build into your mindset that, you know, you have got to look at there has been a possibility. So you know, I think a year ago, people have said, not possible before COVID and now because the world has done $12 trillion of QE and something like $10 trillion to $12 trillion of fiscal stimulus, you have got to put on that thing a scenario where you have higher inflation and not 2%. That would be great. It is like Goldilocks. But like 3%, 4%. Just so you understand what the risk is and how we manage through that. It is not the worst thing in the world by the way. The worst in the world is no growth.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Great. OK. And -- and for my follow-up question, you -- you talked about how you resolved the issue of excess deposits by pricing way about $200 billion of those. So I am just wondering why you don't do that now or is the quantum of the problem that much bigger?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We don't have that all, Jen.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. We don't have to. It's also -- it is slightly different in the sense that there was capacity in the system then to absorb it. This is an issue for everyone. So you know, that -- that could be a challenge. We can't make them go away.Operator




Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, Jamie, on the topic of payments and competition, you know, Libra's -- Facebook's Libra is back out there getting rebranded as Diem and their goal is basically to be global payment network or at least to create one. I am wondering does the OCC stable coin approval do anything for you? You already have JPM coin obviously that's internal to your own footprint? But I am wondering is there any benefit of the OCC stable coin approval, is there anything with regard to Libra competition that's coming that, you know, would -- would drive changes that you are making in your own platforms?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I don't think so. But -- I don't think so. We expect stable --Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 And you know, obviously, there is this talk about several banks having digital currencies and stuff like that, right? Their currency is digital when we move around the world. It's in central banks where it will move by electrons and stuff like that both. So I -- I do expect that stuff is coming and it may not change our world that much. But some of the competitors what they want to do, they want to be in payments. They want the payments data. They want to move the money. Again, it's going to be a regulatory issue about what that means and --Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst And then can I mention --




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible] is not unfair. That's the only thing I can point. So as long as the competition -- as always we can do it safely and competition can do then it's hard to argue this -- that's unfair.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And -- and Betsy, I mentioned earlier, you might have missed it, but it does not impact JPM coin, JPM coin is -- is different. You should think about that as tokenizing deposits to make payments easier for client.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Right. Yeah. No.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah. No. I totally get that. I was just thinking hey, if OCC is allowing stable coin maybe they are trying to, you know, help move the center of this back, you know, into the banking system. That was, you know, kind of a question. The follow-up was just on back to Slide 14 and the other purple, you know, area, where the nontechnology expenses are moving up year on year and part of that is the $30 billion commitment to the path forward initiative. And -- and Jamie, I wanted to understand, like, how you are thinking about that $30 billion? What kind of time frame is that over, you know, and where that money is going? I mean, we put a note out as you know, this past quarter on housing and on housing inequality and wondering how you are thinking about how you are going to be investing that $30 billion in kind of output that you want from it?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Right. So, we believe that inequality is a real problem. And -- and people don't always know, but like, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less, which is $32,000 a year something like that. 50 million don't have employment and people at the lower end are dying quicker than they did before. So first time in our lifetimes, our grandparents lifetimes, American's mortality is getting worse, not better and society have to fix these problems. Now we need healthy growth, healthy growth I mean like, but you also need education, infrastructure, healthcare, and affordability. The racial problem has been around for 100 years and with all the things that took place after even -- after the civil rights, we haven't made the progress we should have made. So we -- and fortunately, lot of other people and companies take this really seriously. How can we help all of the American citizen in particular the black community who has been left behind for so long. So our effort is five years, the $30 billion includes, I've got -- I've got the exact numbers we published $8 billion of mortgages to in lower, middle-income neighborhoods, black neighborhoods, primarily black neighborhoods. It includes affordable housing, building --  affordable housing includes billions of dollars for entrepreneurs of color, it includes defense education. We recently went over a million secure card which is what we expected to do because these are cards that have all the benefits of banking ATMs, online bill pay for $4.95 a month, you know, for lower-paid individuals who are doing more, more education. Of those 400 branches we are opening, 25% or more will be in LMI neighborhoods. We are financing MBI's and CBFI's. So it's a serious effort, it costs $100 million a year. There are hundreds of people involved here.




 So we have a debt how many loan we are going to put in this neighborhood and how many loans we are going to put in that neighborhood. And we are going to report it that to you, we are not going to -- and we are doing work, we don't mind things not working, but it will change courses and stuff like that. And so -- and obviously, it includes hiring more open black community training here and stuff like that. So I think, these efforts, in my own view, is that the corporate world has to do this if you want to fix it. It's not going to happen. We need good government. It is not going to happen just with good government. The jobs at the local level. Unemployment sell branches 20% or 20 is still high. The kids didn't have computer to go home and do their Zooming and schools didn't have them. And unfortunately, a lot of planned appeasing, including my wife, send lot of computers to people there, but we have to do something about this. We are always so forth. And in my view, we should do it for more purposes of loan that would be sufficient, but for commercial purposes do it. If all the parts American doing better, outcomes and more jobs and healthier people, less crying, less prisons, less drugs, and so it's time to get our act together. And again, I think, businesses have to work in collaboration with the government to do it. I just don't think it is going to happen alone.




 It is not going to happen just by yelling at people. You know, the successful companies do not create the slums, but they can help fix them.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 Hi. Just following up more on the market expansion. In commercial banking, could you just drill down deeper on the international part of that expansion and what's left to be done in U.S.?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think -- I'll answer the U.S. but -- are you in U.S.? Again, we are not going to share so much information from now on. But it's the same thing we looked at all the major SMSAs with the middle-market companies, we are doing deep dive in how many there are. And I think, we are now in 75 of the top 75 roughly. So, that expansion is now just going deeper not maybe more at this point. There will be helped little bit by the retail expansion. I think, overseas -- I just -- I just don't have the number on my left hand. 




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I don't know either.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. But if you are talking about -- that will eventually cover and I could be dead wrong in this, 1,000 more clients overseas. These are headquarters or subsidiaries of foreign companies that we probably do business with headquarters subsidiaries in the U.S. and we could share more of this with you later down the road.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And I would just --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I will tell Charlie, he can't imitate me on this one.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Mike, I -- I would just add just from an expense perspective. It is important to remember on the international front that we are riding existing rails that are already there in the CIB. So we can -- this is -- this is an extraordinary opportunity to hire bankers and we already have the infrastructure.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We already -- and we used to generally bank the U.S. subsidiary.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Our U.S. headquarters.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So, it's not the list you might think from an expense perspective.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. And then, just a follow up on the other questions that have been asked related to fintech. Jamie, you said, you are going to win, right. But based on evaluations of the PayPal, Stripes, and Visa, Mastercard anything that fintech related.




 I mean, they -- they trounce valuation of your stock. I think, the market saying that others are going to win. So how is JPMorgan is going to -- I mean you said, Silicon Valley is coming what, that was like six years ago or something and then -- and then each year we say, yeah, we missed it, we missed it, we missed it, well, it's still --Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No. No. No. We never said we -- Mike, we never said we missed it. We have been doing fine over these five years. I started to like -- but -- but I do agree with you, you know, I gave that to the management team. My whole operating committee a little deck that show Visa, $500 billion; Mastercard, $350 billion; PayPal, $220 billion; Ant Financial, $600 billion; Tencent, $800 billion; you know, Alibaba, trillion; Facebook; Google; Apple; Amazon; you can go on and on. But absolutely, we should be scared shitless about that.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst So how are you going to win? I mean, just what -- like what -- Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I am not going to tell you. But we have -- but we have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We just got to get quicker, better, faster, and that's the -- which we do. We have got -- we have done an exceptional.




 If you look at what we have done, you would say, we have done a great job. But other people have done a good job too. Some have monopolies, virtually, it is a whole different issue, but --OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Hi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Hi, hi. Just one follow up. Obviously, Jennifer, you pointed out that your mortgage production revenue was quite healthy in the quarter and you have penetrated the correspondent champ. Can you guys share with us on the servicing side, with the new, you know, with the forbearance programs that the government has put into place, is that a positive or negative for servicing revenue as we go forward?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, gosh.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jen will answer that one.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Yeah. I don't even know exactly how to answer it, Gerard. All I can say is that, when we give -- when -- when we give customers the help that they need -- if that's what the bridge them to the other side of this thing, for sure it is good. So, I -- I don't know precisely what the math is, but there's no doubt it's good if it helps get our customers to the other side. We do service their mortgage.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 In the -- in the past when loans go into delinquency, obviously, and there is -- in a mortgage-backed security, obviously, you guys have to advance the funds and stuff. But the deferral loans are not in that -- I am assuming they are not in that category, is that correct?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Not yet. But you are absolutely right.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 OK.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 The cost of servicing, the default of loan is like 10 times the cost of servicing and nondeposit loans. So Jen is right. Although we don't prudently default, there is probably a small benefit.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Great.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 I -- I -- I got you. We are talking about advancing the -- the servicing cost. Got it.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That's not an issue either.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. No.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Appreciate it.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q3 2020 Earnings CallOct 13, 2020, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2020 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website. And we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $9.4 billion, EPS of $2.92 and revenue of $29.9 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Included in these results are $524 million of legal expenses primarily related to the resolution of legal matters announced last month. Overall in the quarter, while we're still in a very uncertain environment, our underlying business fundamentals performed quite well, so I'll just touch on a few highlights here before getting into the line-of-business results.CIB continued its strong performance with our IB fees of 9% and markets revenue up 30% year on year and we had record revenue in AWM, up 5% year on year. On deposits, while we expected to see some normalization in our balances, instead, we saw another quarter of growth, with average deposits up 5% sequentially. And notably, we moved into the No. 1 spot in U.S. retail deposits with 9.8% market share, gaining 50 basis points of share year on year. On the other hand, average loans were down 4% quarter on quarter, primarily on revolver pay downs from our Wholesale clients. With that, let's turn to Page 2 for more detail on the third-quarter results. We reported revenue of $29.9 billion, which was flat year on year.




 Net interest income was down approximately $1.2 billion or 9% on some lower rates, partly offset by higher Markets NII and balance sheet growth. And noninterest revenue was up $1.2 billion or 7%, primarily driven by CIB, including higher banking and markets revenues as well as net securities gains in corporate. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $500 million or 3% year on year on the higher legal expenses that I already mentioned. This quarter, credit costs of approximately $600 million were down $900 million year on year, primarily driven by modest reserve releases, which you can see in more detail on Page 3. We released approximately $600 million of reserves this quarter, primarily on run-off in Home Lending and changes in Wholesale loan exposure. Charge-offs across our portfolios remained relatively low and, in fact, were down slightly year on year and quarter on quarter. While we could see an uptick in charge-offs over the next few quarters, given payment relief and government stimulus already provided, and we don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our updated base case reflects some improvement from last quarter. However, the medium to longer term is still highly uncertain in particular as it relates to future stimulus. And so we remain heavily weighted to our downsize scenarios, and with reserves of just $33.8 billion, we're prepared for something worse than the base case. And now turning to Page 4. I'll provide a quick update on what we're seeing in our customer assistance programs. You can see here that the vast majority of Card & Auto customers have exited relief, and so what's left in deferral is primarily in Home Lending, including $11 billion of owned loans and $17 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we're seeing with our customers that have exited relief, approximately 90% of accounts remain current. Now turning to balance sheet and capital on Page 5. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up 60 basis points versus last quarter on earnings generation and lower RWA, partially offset by dividends of $2.8 billion.




 It's worth noting that we have over $1.3 trillion of liquidity sources available to us across HQLA and unencumbered securities. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. CCB reported net income of $3.9 billion and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of $12.8 billion was down 9% year on year driven by deposit margins compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, partially offset by deposit growth and strong Home Lending production margins. Deposit growth was 28% year on year, up over $190 billion, largely on the lower spending and higher cash buffers across both our consumer and small business customers as well as organic growth. Client investment assets were up 11% year on year driven by both net inflows and market performance. Overall, consumer customers are holding up well. They have built savings relative to pre-COVID levels and at the same time, lower debt balances. With regard to digital adoption, early signs suggest the increased customer migration to the digital will persist. In fact, nearly 69% of our customers are digitally active, and that's up 3 percentage points year on year and accelerating. And quick deposit now represents more than 40% of all check deposits versus 30% pre-COVID. Moving on to consumer lending. Starting with Home Lending. Total originations were down 10% year on year driven by correspondent. However, consumer volumes were up 46% year on year. And notably, more than half of consumer applications were completed digitally, twice the level of the first quarter.




 In Cards, while our net sales were down 8% year on year, spend continued to improve throughout the quarter. And in the month of September, sales were down only 3% year on year, reflecting the lowest decline since March. Retail, which is a significant portion of overall spend, was a bright spot, reaching double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter, largely driven by card-not-present transactions. And then in Auto, record originations for the quarter of $11.4 billion were up 25% year on year. Total CCB loans were down 7% year on year, with Home Lending down 15% due to some portfolio run-off and Cards down 11% on lower spend, offset by Business Banking, up 83% due PPP loans. Expenses of $6.8 billion were down 4% predominantly due to lower marketing investments. And lastly, credit cost of $794 million included a $300 million reserve release in Home Lending and net charge-offs of $1.1 billion driven by Cards. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 21% on revenue of $11.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was up 12% year on year and down sequentially off an all-time record quarter, and we maintained our No. 1 rank in IB fees year to date. And the quarter's performance was largely driven by our equity capital markets business, which saw an uptick in IPO issuance driven by a strong equity backdrop with stocks trading at or near all-time highs. In advisory, we were down 15% year on year, largely impacted by the muted M&A announced volumes in the first half of the year. However, we saw a surge in M&A activity this quarter with announced volumes returning to pre-COVID levels as companies began to shift their focus from day-to-day operations to more strategic and opportunistic thinking. Debt underwriting fees were also up 5% year on year but down 21% sequentially as we saw investment-grade activity return to more normalized levels from the record volumes we saw in the second quarter. The leveraged finance market continued to recover with high-yield spreads approaching pre-COVID levels and some notable acquisition financing deals closing.




 We maintained our No. 1 rank in overall wallet, and we're the leaders in lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 42% year on year, resulting in the best third quarter ever, primarily driven by our strong performance in the IPOs and follow-ons. In terms of the outlook, we expect fourth quarter IB fees to be roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year and down sequentially. However, if valuations remain elevated, we could continue to see momentum in capital markets. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, up 30% year on year. While activity continued to normalize, with spread, volume and volatility reducing from the elevated levels of the first half of the year, the performance was strong throughout the quarter and across products, reflecting the resilience and the earnings power of this franchise through a broad range of market conditions. Fixed income was up 29% year on year against a strong third quarter last year driven by a favorable trading environment across products, notably in commodities as well as elevated client activity in credit and securitized products. Equities was up 32% year on year on continued robust client activity in equity derivatives as well as a recovery in prime balances and a solid performance in cash. Looking forward, it's important to remember that 4Q '19 performance was very strong, making for a difficult year-on-year comparison. And obviously, forecasting market performance still remains very challenging in this environment. Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.3 billion was down 5% year on year driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by balance growth as well as a reporting reclassification in merchant services. Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was flat year on year, where higher deposit balances were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 5% compared to the prior year largely due to higher legal expense, partially offset by lower structural and volume- and revenue-related expenses. So, now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8.




 Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was flat year on year driven by deposit margin compression, offset by higher balances and fees and higher lending revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $840 million was up 20% year on year on increased debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $966 million were up 3% year on year. Average loans were up 5% year on year but down 7% quarter on quarter due to declines in revolver utilization by C&I clients and lower origination volume in CRE. Deposits of $248 billion were up 44% year on year and 5% quarter on quarter as client balances remain elevated. Finally, our credit costs were a net benefit of $147 million, including a $207 million reserve release and net charge-offs of $60 million. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $877 million with pre-tax margin of 31% and ROE of 32%. Record revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 5% year on year as growth in deposit and loan balances, along with higher management fees and brokerage activity, were largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were flat year on year, with -- credit costs were a net benefit of $51 million, primarily due to reserve releases. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $34 billion were positive across all channels and driven by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity outflows of $33 billion. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.5 trillion, up 16% and 15% year on year, respectively, were driven by net inflows into liquidity and long-term products as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 23% year on year, and loans were up 13%, with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on Page 10.




 Corporate reported a net loss of approximately $700 million. Revenue was a loss of $339 million, down $1 billion year over year, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities, partially offset by $466 million of net securities gains in the quarter. Expenses of $719 million were up $438 million year on year primarily due to an impairment on a legacy investment. Now let's turn to Page 11 for the outlook. You'll see here that our full year outlook for 2020 remains in line with what I said at Barclays. We expect net interest income to be approximately $55 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $66 billion. And that while we don't have anything on the page for 2021 and we're not planning to do Investor Day, we'll share more color with you on the outlook in the first quarter of next year. So to wrap up, even though recent economic data has been more constructive than we would have expected this -- earlier this year, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty. And so we continue to prepare for a broad range of outcomes while focusing on serving our customers, clients and communities through this time. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: Operator




[Operator instructions]Our first question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. So I think one of the key questions on investors' minds right now is how will banks grow revenue kind of medium term here as we think about lower-for-longer rates? And I was hoping you could just talk about how you think about managing the company if rates stay very low for a long time and how you can grow revenue. And obviously, year to date, the revenue has been very good, up 4%. And if you could just squeeze in the branch expansion that you alluded to in the comments as part of that answer, that would be helpful.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So in terms of how we think about the revenue outlook for 2021, first of all, it's early and we'll come back to you in the first quarter with more details. But it is true that if we think about the NII outlook, that that will be under pressure relative to 2020 and I can't give more detail on that. But also, we are on pace for record revenue in markets and investment banking, and so that will be a tough compare. Having said that, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of what might be temporary rate headwinds, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base. And with that branch expansion -- we are continuing on our plans in branch expansion. We have, I think, almost 120 branches open in our expansion markets. We'll do more than another 150. So far this year, we got approval to enter 10 additional states, which we'll ultimately put up in all lower 48. So we continue with the branch expansion and remain very excited about it with those new branches, in most cases, performing well above the original business case.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Can I just add to that to give you a little bit of longer-term view? There's not one single business or not any bankers, countries, products, digital. We're growing securities services and cash management services. We're adding -- we're growing the Chase wealth management business. We're adding private bankers. We're adding products in Asset Management. And we kind of look through all the things -- I kind of call them the weather. We just keep on growing. The branch expansion is one example of that. We never stopped doing that. We never stopped gaining credit card products. We never stopped growing digital Home Lending products, and we'll be doing that for the next decade. And of course, you have all these ins and out from what I call the weather: NII, spreads, margins, markets, etc., but the goal is always the same. You grow the business to serve your clients around the world.




Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And then as a follow-up, Jen, you'd said that you'd elaborate on the net interest income. I don't know if you meant now or you're going to wait until January for that in terms of the outlook for next year, just some puts and takes.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So there, I had said at Barclays that the current run rate was a good place to start. So $13 billion is a good place to start and for 2021 reflects the impact of the rate environment and some normalization in market's NII.But from there, balance sheet growth and mix should be supportive throughout the year. And so for the full year of 2021, my best view at this point would be $53 billion, plus or minus.




 But yes, we'll sharpen our pencils on that and continue to provide updates. But right now, full year, $53 billion.OperatorOur next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

 Good morning. So I guess the reserve release was definitely driven by mortgage prepay and run-offs, I get that. But NPAs were still up 18% quarter on quarter. I wonder if you could talk about what drove that. Maybe comment on commercial real estate specifically. It'd be appreciated. Thanks.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So the reserve release, as you said, was largely on portfolio run-off and changes in exposure in Wholesale, so not a reflection of a change in our outlook. And then the increase in nonaccrual loans is -- on the consumer side is mortgage, and it represents the customers that have come out of forbearance and are not paying. And so as you saw on that slide, the payment deferral slide, about 90% are still current.




 The other 10% has now been reflected in the nonaccrual exposure. So that is all mortgage. And then the increase in nonaccrual on the wholesale side was just a few name-specific downgrades, which are in sectors you would expect, as you just said, retail-related real estate and oil and gas. And then more broadly on commercial real estate, I'll just share that we feel adequate reserve for what we're facing. But if you look at rent collection as an example overall, with the exception of retail, between 85% and 95%. And then even retail in the month of September was about 80% -- has recovered to about 80%. So still a lot of uncertainty there, but we feel adequately reserved.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. I appreciate that. Maybe one on asset management. You have been doing great.




 I don't need to ask on your specific business. But in the past, you've spoken about potential interest in participating in industry consolidation. We saw some of that happening lately. Can you just talk -- remind us about the parameters of what you would and might not be interested in doing in asset and wealth management?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, since we have you all on the line, our doors and our telephone lines are wide open. We would be very interested, and we do think you will see consolidation in the business but we're not going to be more specific than that. [Inaudible] product-sensitive, the systems, the technology, the business projects, the ability to execute, there's lot -- there are a lot of issues that will determine whether something makes sense for us in there.Operator




Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. Hey, Jen and Jamie, that was some comment. You said you do not expect much higher charge-offs until the second half of next year, and that's even with the higher NPAs. So what are your assumptions behind that, Jen, as far as specifically when the forbearance actions run their course? And, Jamie, policy actions that might be embedded in that expectation?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 OK. So I'll just start, Mike, with, first of all, the increase in nonaccrual was on mortgage. And when you look at the LTV on those -- the loan to value on those loans, that's what is embedded into how we're thinking about the -- what charge-offs will look like in the near term. There's still very healthy LTVs on those loans. So really, when we talk about losses really emerging in a significant way, not until the back half of '21, we're talking about cards. And just given the amount of stimulus and payment relief and just support in the system, we haven't seen the delinquency buckets begin to fill up, and we charge 180 days past due in cards. So that is primarily just a timing issue as it relates to cards. We could see increases in charge-offs in the next few quarters on the wholesale side or maybe here and there on the consumer side. It's just that the meaningful change in charge-offs, we don't expect until the second half of 2021.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. And, Mike, about policy, first of all, I wouldn't say that policy is determinative here because this is unprecedented times. And what we're saying is that policy will matter and will skew the odds of having a better outcome. So I think the policy -- obviously, the Fed is doing what it can to keep markets open, but the policy on the fiscal side is just some kind of continuation of unemployment insurance and PPP. So, those are the two most vulnerable areas to just maximize the chance that we'll have better outcomes and I do think that over time, intelligent return to work. I caution people -- remember, 100 million people go to work every day. So the complete focus is on the 50 million who don't go to work. But the 100 million who go to work, it's rather safe. There's a lot of examples where you do the social distancing and the cleaning and all the various things like that, that it may be safer than being home in your community. And so -- but the getting back to work is a little bit important because you look at cities and travel and a whole bunch of stuff. There are a lot of people who are under a lot of stress and strain who won't be able to survive another year of complete closedown. So the other policy is numerous, rational, thoughtful return to the office, done properly, which will help all those businesses support the big office towers and buildings and stuff like that. And those two things will maximize the chance of good outcome. They don't guarantee the chance of a good outcome.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And I know this is a tough question, but you're in the middle of the stress test part two. When all is said and done, Jamie or Jen, where do you think these charge-offs go as a percentage of the global financial crisis? You have to have -- I know you have scenarios, but where should we think -- is it like half the GFC level, same as GFC level, twice the GFC level? What are you guys thinking at the back of your mind?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer It's a very difficult question to answer. It's very different, of course, because the GFC was heavily mortgage-related, and this will probably be less so. We also -- our portfolios are in significantly better shape coming into this, whether it's mortgage or card. But just given the amount of uncertainty about where this could go, we still have 12 million people unemployed, I think it's very difficult.




 I don't know, Jamie, whether you would add.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's very hard -- I agree with you, Jen. It's very hard to say. And, Mike, it depends on the outcome. Again, we look at the good case, the medium case, the relative adverse case and the extreme adverse case. And there, the answers are completely different, and we don't know the future. So it's hard to predict what it's going to be. But our reserves are prepared pre -- relative to the adverse case, which is equal to the -- roughly equivalent to CCAR extreme adverse case that we just got, roughly. Again, very hard to compare apples to apples in these things.




OperatorOur next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. I'm going to ask the two questions that I often get from investors that are hesitant to dip their toe back into bank stocks. And the first is -- and Jen, this goes back to your earlier comment.




 The one question I get on credit quality is did stimulus and policy redefine cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle? In other words, I think Jamie said changed the outcome or do you think it just delayed the realization of these losses?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I think it's difficult to know. I think the purpose of it was to change the outcome, not just delay the losses. But it's difficult to know. People sort of described it as a bridge, and the question is whether the bridge will be long enough and strong enough to bridge people back to employment and bridge small businesses back to normalcy. So I think it remains to be seen. As Jamie said, we're obviously preparing for it to not necessarily change the outcome, obviously, because we built significant reserves. So we're prepared for it to be a delay rather than change the outcome.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. And my follow-up question, and perhaps if I could direct this to Jamie. This is a bit of a follow-up to Matt's earlier question but investors are essentially worried on the other side of the credit recovery about what the interest rate environment may imply for ""normalized ROTCE."" And as you think about what you mentioned to be ""weather considerations,"" what prevents JP Morgan from going back to that 17%, 19% ROTCE that you posted in '18 and '19?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, you guys know that's a forecast of the future. It's hard to tell. I think negative interest rates are a bad idea and will probably force, over time, the banking industry to strength, which means they'd be buying back stock and doing other things with their capital. But I -- but we're able to handle low rates, and we can have decent returns at low rates.




 I think it's a bad long-term strategy. I also think it's a bad idea for you all to assume they're going to continue like that forever. I mean we had massive global QE in the last go around, and we didn't have inflation. So I remind people, a lot of that QE was around Fed. The Fed and the central banks support securities so that would create deposits to banks. The banks support to put deposits in the central banks. So it was not new inflationary fiscal stimulus. Fiscal stimulus, which has been extraordinary around the world is, by its nature, inflationary. And so we don't really know the outcome of that. But my view, and what I tell investors, we're going to build our businesses day in and day out regardless of interest rate environments, etc., and we have plans to adjust interest rate environments. We can not do certain things. We can charge for certain things. We can do a whole bunch of different stuff. But the services is still required, moving money around the world, trading for people, underwriting securities, helping manage their money, and we'll be OK. We'll work through it.




OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Hi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. I had two questions. One was be interested in understanding how you are threading the needle between your outlook here for reserve and the potential to buy back stock. You've got the reserve level high with a base case outlook for unemployment that's above where we are today for the next six months, it looks like, or even longer.




 And your capital build is obviously continuing to increase here. So how should we think about that? Could we imagine that your buyback could kick off before reserve release happens? And would you release reserves before the net charge-offs start to come through, like you mentioned, in second half '21?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So as we -- first of all, on stock buybacks, obviously, we are restricted here in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the Fed will see what they need and get what they need in the resubmission to give them the confidence to revert to a more normal distribution framework under SCB in the first quarter. So that's obviously the most important hurdle for us. And then if we have excess capital -- and the reserve division and the buyback division are not related to one another. We are always going to make sure that we have our best estimate of losses that we're facing considering the uncertainty as well. And then, of course, our capital hierarchy would always look to grow our businesses, first and foremost. But if we have excess capital and if we do not have regulatory restrictions, you could see us buy back stock as early as the first quarter.




 And like I said, that wouldn't necessarily be related to a reserve release. The other thing on potential reserve releases, we obviously need to see the economy continue to deliver on the base case to give us the confidence that, that is what we're dealing with. But I would just say that, remember there was a capital release -- a partial capital release on CECL builds. So when you release reserves, only about half of that actually falls through to capital.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst And could you talk a little -- Jen, could you talk a little bit about the Slide 3 where you've got the base case outlook for unemployment? And just give us a sense as to what's driving this base case outlook for unemployment in 4Q '20 at 9.5% and then 20 -- 2Q '21 at 8.5%? They're obviously above where we are today. And could you help us understand how you're thinking about flexing that going forward? What would change those assumptions?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. That's like largely, Betsy, a timing issue with when we actually run the models for the reserve. That's not necessarily, as you rightly point out, reflective of our autonomous latest outlook. So we would, as we progress through the fourth quarter, use the latest outlook for the base case. But then again, as Jamie said, we look at a number of different scenarios. And depending upon what we think we're dealing with in terms of the uncertainty, then we may continue to heavily weight the downside scenarios or maybe even more heavily weight the downside scenarios. We have to see. So if you look at the weighted outcome of all of the scenarios that we use to derive the reserves, it is -- we are prepared for a double-digit unemployment, peak unemployment level. But so -- it would now start with the revised base case, shall I say, from our comments.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. Kind of just put into perspective just a little bit, the capital. I mean we have extraordinary amounts of capital, $200 billion. We've got $1.3 trillion of liquid assets and securities. And the way you should look at it is the $200 billion in just next eight quarters will earn PPNR like pre-tax, pre-provision earnings of roughly $80 billion, give or take. We don't know exactly what that's going to be. So with that $80 billion, if things get better, it will be more than that, and we take down reserves. If it didn't get worse, it may be about that. All the worse than that, we have to put up $20 billion. Even if you put up the $20 billion, in my view, that won't emerge in a quarter. That will emerge over several quarters, which also means you can buy -- pay the dividend, buy back stock, have plenty of capital and still be very conservatively capitalized. And that's the reality of it. OK? Forget all the other stuff you read. And we're conservative. We like to be conservative regarding loan loss reserves and capital. So we'll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes.




 And I hope we're allowed to do it too before the stock is much higher.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And the $20 billion that Jamie referenced, as we talked about the extreme adverse scenario last quarter. So you can think that that's the $20 billion that Jamie is referencing, if that is what --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. And that $20 billion is unemployment of 12%, 13% that goes off into the better part of six quarters. I mean it's really extremely adverse. It's far worse than the CCAR case we just got.OperatorOur next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst




 Good morning. Jen, you mentioned that next year, you have some tough revenue comps. Can you talk about the notion of expense flexibility at JP Morgan? Underneath the surface of flattish expenses, where are you on saving money from digitization and structural change? And how does that give you flexibility against where you'd like to be investing?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So first of all, it's early. We're still working through next year. So I will certainly refine the guidance in the first quarter. But as it relates to expenses, we will -- and you mentioned digital, that's one. We will continue to deliver on our structural expense efficiencies as we have been for the last several years. There will -- as we do expect the world to normalize a bit, there will be opportunity in volume and revenue-related expenses. But we're going to continue to invest.




 And so there will be puts and takes, and we'll just provide you more detailed guidance in the first quarter.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. And as a follow-up, on capital, can you talk about the notion of reducing your SCB and maybe your GSIB surcharge footprint over time? I think you had commented that there's potential to do that. What is the path and the route to doing that? And how do you feel about the prospects for those two things getting better over time?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So I'll start with GSIB, which is that we do expect to be in the 4% bucket at the end of this year, but it is not effective immediately. And so we will have 2021 to manage that back down. What I would say there is that with the Fed balance sheet of -- at these levels possibly expanding, that makes managing the GSIB back down quite challenging. So in the absence of recalibration, which we remain hopeful about, managing that back down will certainly be challenging but not impossible, but we'll really certainly think about any impact on our client franchise before we do anything. So we have some time there. We could see recalibration, that would help. But no doubt that, that's a challenge. On SCB, I'd start by saying it's scenario-dependent, of course. So all else equal, we do think that we have opportunities to manage down the SCB, and so that can include transferring securities from AFS to held to maturity and then some other mechanical issues on our side that we're confident will now, all things equal, reduce our SCB. But again, it's scenario-dependent. So all that being said, John, I would just say that our expectation at this point over time is that our target capital level of 11.5% to 12% is -- should be unchanged over time.Operator




Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. Jen, Jamie, you mentioned earlier that you've got $1.3 trillion of cash and securities. It didn't look like you really changed the size of the investments portfolio this quarter, but you did make a bunch of moves into held to maturity from available for sale. And I'm just wondering, you guys have talked about expectation that deposits might settle down, but they're continuing to grow. And so what can you do at this point and going forward with the move -- starting to move some of that cash into things that might at least earn some more to protect the NII going forward? Thanks.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So I'll talk --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Jen, I just want to say that we're not going to do anything to protect the NII. We have $300 billion of cash we can invest today, and that becomes $400 billion. We're not going to invest it in stuff making 50, 60 or 70 basis points, so we get to see a teeny little bit more of NII. But we're going to make long-term decisions for the company.




 And if your NII gets squeezed a little bit, so be it. But we don't want to be in a position where we lose a lot of money because you may invest in some five- or 10-year securities, which you'll lose a lot if rates go up. So we're not protecting NII.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So as a principal matter, it's important to remember that we manage the portfolio across multiple dimensions, not just optimizing NII, as Jamie said. And we're thinking about capital protection at these levels. But just in terms of the activity that you saw in the securities portfolio, we've been very active. We added about $160 billion through now the end of Q2. In Q3, we were active buyers and sellers because in Q3, we saw attractive selling opportunities, which made economic sense for us. So just to Jamie's point, so you give up some NII, but it just made economic sense for us, but we have -- we were also buying in the third quarter. We also focused -- or focused on optimizing liabilities with the excess liquidity.




 So you'll see that our debt is down nearly $40 billion from last quarter. So then just in terms of the transfer to held to maturity with the significant growth in securities portfolio, it just made sense from a capital protection perspective. And it's also helpful for SCB as I mentioned, and these were high-quality core holdings.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yes. I fully agree on that duration point, Jamie. A follow-up just on -- if you think about the fee businesses and some of the --James DimonYou guys should also be raising the question about why moving some of the held to maturity, reducing SCB. Like that is a rational thing, which I don't think it is. But that's what it is and that's what we're going to deal with. It's why we can drive down SCB.




 Yes.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer On duration, with 10-year has backed up a bit over the last couple of weeks, and so we have been -- we'll remain opportunistic, but we have added at these levels.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 Great. And then just one follow-up on just fees in general. You've got the consumer fee businesses that are still trying to get back to where they were a year ago. And then last quarter, Jamie had made this comment about cut it in half and trading, and it wasn't anywhere close to that, which was positive. It's still quite, quite good. And how you think through just the pushes and pulls between fees as you look forward, right, in terms of how much better do you think the consumer can get from where it is? So, how much, if any, are the institutional businesses over-earning relative to where they posted in the first half?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So on consumer fees, you'll see that consumer fees recovered a bit in the third quarter. The decline there was both release actions that we took, but also because of the higher cash buffers that consumers are experiencing that also impacts fees. And so -- and that's a good thing, so we'll take that.




 So that did recover a bit in the third quarter, but that will take time to get back to what you might consider normalized levels. And then on the institutional side, we did expect to see markets normalize in the third quarter. And we did also that that a bit, but not as much as we had thought when we were at second quarter earnings. And IB fees also continued to be very strong in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations for what we might have thought in the second quarter. Looking forward, though, the fourth quarter is a tough compare. So we do -- and we do expect markets to continue to normalize. And then on the IB fee side, our pipeline is flattish to what it was last year. It's just still down a bit in M&A, but we did see M&A recover in the third quarter, and it's up in ECM. So as I said, flattish in the fourth quarter feels about right at this point.Operator




Our next question is from Steve Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. So, Jen, I was hoping you could speak to the expectations for loan growth across both the institutional and consumer channels. When do you anticipate we could begin to see balances quite positively? And separately, just what level of loan growth is contemplated in the $53 billion NII guide that you provided for '21?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So loan growth will be challenged, I think, for-- in the short term. On the Wholesale side, I think we'll probably tread water at these levels, but increasing CEO confidence with M&A activity and capital investment should be supportive of more normalized loan growth, but that may take some time. On the consumer side, we are seeing cards continue to revert to more normal levels. And so that will continue into 2021, but that could be offset by continued prepays in the mortgage. So there will be puts and takes there. And then asset management, I think we'll continue to see solid growth. So net-net, not significant loan growth, but the mix will be helpful because of the card growth is supportive of a mix benefit on NII.Steve Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst And maybe a question for you, Jamie. You had alluded to potential for charging for additional products and services to offset rate pressures. And I was hoping you could speak to some of the areas where you might look to potentially charge clients. So just philosophically, how you're handicapping the risk of client attrition if competitors ultimately don't follow suit.




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There is -- first of all, I don't think it's going to happen, so I don't spend too much time worrying about it. But we have, as a company matter, gone through everything we do and how we do it and how we respond to negative rates. I'm not going through account by account. But like I said, while these are necessary services, all the competitors -- it's a competitive world, I agree with you. If competitors don't do stuff, you have a hard time doing it. But I think that you will see a lot of competitors respond to negative rates in a lot of different ways. So there will be an opportunity, and something like that.Operator




Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities LLC -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a question on deposit growth. I think we've all been surprised at the continued growth. Can you just kind of talk to what you're seeing? It looked like we had further growth in September. Are you expecting this to continue? Is it sort of moving out of money markets into deposits? What do you think is driving the growth? And do you expect it to continue?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So there's no doubt that with the Fed being this active that there is significant excess liquidity in the system. We did think that we would see deposits normalized in the third quarter, both on consumer spending on the consumer side and then on just the wholesale side in places like security services, with asset managers hold cash on the sidelines. We didn't what we thought we would. So yes, we did continue to see deposit growth here in the third quarter. Going forward, I think that normalization is still just very much a part of our outlook except for that. Given that the normalization is a bit deferred here, it will likely be offset by the continued organic growth, perhaps more than offset by continued organic growth.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities LLC -- Analyst




 Right. Makes sense. And then maybe a follow-up on credit. I mean I appreciate that we're not going to see charge-offs given where delinquencies are today. But what do you think -- how do we think about delinquencies and what triggers you to either release or build reserves? I would imagine that we'll see it -- you would be making those decisions before charge-offs. Where do we see delinquencies? You've had very good experience so far in your core book as well as the deferrals acting well. When do we -- are we -- I mean it just seems very surprising that we haven't seen delinquencies tick up yet in any material way. When do you expect that or is it really all dependent on sort of the goodwill of the government?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we -- one of the reasons we haven't seen delinquencies tick up is because of the payment relief, but also the extraordinary support that has been provided through stimulus. So we'll probably see delinquencies tick up in the early part of 2021. We're not assuming further stimulus beyond the end of this year and how we think about reserves. So we do think you'll start to see delinquencies tick up early 2021 and then charge-offs in the back half of 2021.




 I think future stimulus would give us more confidence in the economy delivering on the base case. There's just a lot of factors that we'll be looking at as we think about the right level of our reserves over the coming quarters, and delinquencies will be just one part of that.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Thank you. Good morning, Jennifer.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 I may have missed this, I had to jump off for a minute on the call but can you give us some color? As you've spoken very well about what's going on in the consumer credit area, but when you go into the commercial side of the business, can you share what the sectors that you're seeing the biggest challenges? And can you give us some color on the rerating process that you're going through on those credits that are in trouble today and what kind of deterioration you're seeing in those specific credits in terms of possibly writedowns or revaluations or if it's collateral, like in a commercial real estate loan?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So the sectors, I think, are ones that you would expect: airlines, lodging, restaurants, other T&E, real estate, oil and gas. And those continue to be the sectors under the most pressure. When you look at downgrades here in the third quarter -- or not here in the third quarter -- in the third quarter, we saw downgrades slow a bit because in the second quarter, we saw significant downgrades just on the increased level of debt that companies were taking on. So we saw downgrades slow a bit in the third quarter, but we do expect downgrades to continue, particularly in real estate. And then elsewhere, in wholesale, I would say CEO sentiment is guarded, but constructive.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know you -- Jamie touched on interest rates and how you're very focused in growing your business in any rate environment. Could you give us some color, inflation, if it does pick up and if we get a steepening in the curve? Obviously, Chairman Powell has indicated he is not going to move on rates for quite some time. But if we're looking in your third quarter of, let's say, '21 and then 10-year government bond yield is, let's say, the 125 basis points, can you just give us some color? I know that's not your prediction, but what would that do for the margin in revenues if we were fortunate enough now to see a steeper curve due to higher inflation?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer It's a great number. I don't have the sensitivity to hand if it would be -- go ahead, Jamie.




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I'd tell you, there's a disclosure we make in the 10-Q, it shows what would happen if rates go up 100 basis points. I forgot the number, Jen, isn't like, I'm going to say, $2.5 billion a year, with the rolls and as a piece of that, but the smaller piece. The rolls -- and that rolls in and compounds over time. But that's not the right way to look at it. You have to ask the why. If you have an active environment, rates are going up, we're going to have more volume and more NII. If you have stagflation, by a big chance, that's just a really good idea. So the why is more important than just the what here.




OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Hello? Sorry about that, I was on mute. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question, I think it was from Ken -- on probably sales and trading. But you're tracking this year in sales and trading to a revenue of close to $30 billion. And if we go back to, say, 2010, shortly after the crisis, it's been pretty consistently the annual revenues in, say, the $18 billion to $21 billion range.




 There was obviously a lot of volatility on a quarterly basis, but it's generally been in that range. And so how do we think about, or frame the range of outcomes as market conditions normalize? Do you feel like there have been changes in terms of either share or market structure that maybe allow you to have a larger revenue base than the -- and more revenues from those businesses than you have had historically even as market conditions normalize or is it just kind of too hard to tell? I'm just trying to think through because you obviously had a pretty big impact on your overall PPNR and revenue forecast going forward.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I think that -- I mean as you know, we're on pace for a record year. So I think any compares are going to be challenging, and we do expect the market to continue to normalize. And that could be partially offset by share gains, as you mentioned, but it is never a good idea to try to forecast market even early in the quarter, never mind the year before. I don't know, Jamie, do you want to add anything?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I'd say, look, this is a ground working. We got a lot of tough competitors, and we're all building systems and stuff like that. They can do a better job to that. Almost impossible to forecast short-term numbers in that.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Yes. No -- and I understand that. I totally get that and appreciate that. It's just that you're kind of tracking to a revenue that's about 50% higher than what you've done in the post -- any year in the post-crisis environment or to that, somewhere to that effect. So just that delta between the current run rate and what has been a more normalized run rate is pretty sizable. So I'm just trying to get any color in terms of kind of thinking through kind of a range of outcomes for just where that could settle in, and not necessarily in a given quarter, per se, but just more on a normalized base as you think about the business as a whole.




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So I'd say our trader did -- have done an exceptional job. But I would say the second quarter will not be typical and the third quarter probably won't. Hopefully, it might be better than what it's been in the past couple of years, but we don't know. But remember, the market itself, total bonds, total assets under management, total credit cards, total mortgage products, total global products, that's growing over time. So there is this underlying growth as we spread, we sell them around, our competition moves around.Operator




Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one, you've got $33.8 billion of reserves. I guess that's in line with an extreme adverse scenario. I know you can't tell what's going to happen going forward given these many different variables, but we've already seen some of that being released. So I was wondering if we had the base case scenario pan out over the coming years, how much of that $33.8 billion should we be -- expect to be released then back through the P&L and over what time period?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I'll start by saying we're not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. So we are reserved for something worse than this base case because we have put heavy weight on scenarios that are worse than the base case, but we are not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. And the release this quarter was, first of all, very small in the grand scheme of things and was almost exclusively related to portfolio runoff or the exposure changes, and not anything to do with the change in our outlook. And then if the economy delivers the base case, you will see reserve releases from us in coming quarters, but it is very, very difficult to try to tell you how much and when.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst I mean surely, you've got like -- you can make like an estimate of your reserves if you did assume the base case going forward. And I guess, it's the difference between you --




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I've already said that the base case -- if the Fed base case happens, there's probably something like $10 billion of reserve.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst $10 billion over reserved?




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Over reserved, if that happens.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst [Inaudible]




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, no. $10 billion over reserved.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Got it. Understood.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And I mentioned it earlier, it's just important to remember that there were capital modifications to CECL. So only about half of that ends up in capital, because as you release your reserves --Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Yes, of course.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst Got it. Understood. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up question on your CET1 ratio.




 You had a nice pickup there this quarter. Obviously, you've had strong earnings, but you've also had a near 2% reduction in risk-weighted assets. I'm just wondering if you could give a bit more color on the moving parts there and how you expect that to play out in the coming quarters.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's largely -- the RWA reduction was largely on revolver paydowns. So I wouldn't expect that kind of pace to continue. We will continue to bill if we're not allowed to buy back stock, but we will continue to build capital on earnings, so probably less so on RWA reduction.Operator




Our next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.Charles Peabody -- Portale Partners, LLC -- Analyst Yes. Good morning. A question about your rate sensitivity to the long end. If I look at a time series going back to the second quarter of last year, your rate sensitivity has increased every single quarter to a steepening yield curve. In other words, your NII would improve for more than the yield curve steepened at the long end. So my question is, was that an intended action or residual effect? Because I did notice that you've been adding fairly significantly to your MBS portfolio.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So Charles, I don't know precisely the answer to that, but it's largely going to be, I'm assuming, on the growth in our deposit base, which then has supported the growth in the securities portfolio.Charles Peabody -- Portale Partners, LLC -- Analyst OK. It's substantial. I mean if you go back to the second quarter of last year, you had a $600 million potential increase, and second quarter of this year was $1.7 billion. Anyway, my second question is related to the legacy impairment charge.




 Can you give us some color around that, what sort of asset class that was in? And is it over half a billion, under half a billion?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So under $0.5 billion of what remains, and it was a legacy investment that we took an impairment on, and it's not meaningful in the grand scheme of things.Operator




Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst OK. Thanks. Just a quick question to start with, maybe as you think about kind of what you've been doing for a customer accommodation. As it relates to the pandemic, I know there would have been fee waivers first quarter, second quarter of this year. But what kind of customer accommodation was happening in the third quarter? Is it kind of a clean number from a fees perspective in the third quarter or is there still a certain level of accommodation going on?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 There is probably -- I don't actually know. Jason and team can get you the detail. It's less than what it was in the second quarter, and it's more -- the -- what we mean in terms of the reduction in fees is more a function of cash buffers.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst OK. And then is there a way that you can give an update on the IB pipeline, but on a geographic basis? I mean as we've seen negative highlights around COVID kind of around the world, is there different pipelines building in different regions?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 There's less of a regional story. But from a product perspective, overall, we're flattish to last year, but M&A is a little bit lower. Importantly though, we're covered quite nicely in the third quarter, and ECM is a little bit higher, but overall flattish.OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 OK. Thanks, everyone.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 61 minutes

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q2 2020 Earnings CallJul 14, 2020, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorPlease standby. We are about to begin. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second-quarter 2020 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $4.7 billion, EPS of $1.38 and record revenue of $33.8 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 9%. Included in these results are a number of significant items: First, a credit reserve build of $8.9 billion and then approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book and $500 million of gains in credit adjustments and other, both of which represent reversals of some of the losses we took in the first quarter. As we continue to navigate this challenging and uncertain environment, this quarter's performance once again demonstrates the benefits of the diversification and scale of our platform. So I'll just touch on a few highlights here.CIB reported its highest quarterly revenue on record, with IB fees up 54% and markets revenue up 79% year on year, each representing record performances with strength across the board. We saw record consumer deposit growth of 20%, up over $130 billion year on year. And firmwide average deposits were $1.9 trillion, up 25% year on year and 16% quarter on quarter. Average loans were up 4% year on year and quarter on quarter, largely reflecting the COVID-related loan growth that we saw in March.




 However, on an end-of-period basis, loans were down 4% quarter on quarter due to revolver paydowns as well as lower balances in card and home lending partially offset by the impact of $28 billion of PPP loans. And lastly, we increased our CET1 ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter after building approximately $9 billion of reserves and paying nearly $3 billion of common dividends. As you'll recall, we started the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in March. On the following pages, I'll give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at last quarter and share what we're seeing today. So with that, let's turn to Page 2. Starting with wholesale on the top of the page, we saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the quarter as clients bought to pay down the majority of the revolver draws for March and continued to shore up liquidity while market conditions were receptive, supported by extraordinary Central Bank actions. The surge in investment-grade debt issuance seen in March continued throughout the second quarter. And as high-yield markets reopened, U.S. issuance volumes increased by 90% compared to the first quarter. In ECM, as markets rebounded to pre-COVID levels, May and June together were our two busiest months for equity issuance ever driven by converts end follow-ons. Moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left. Debit and credit sales volume, while overall still down, has consistently trended upwards since the trough in the second week of April to down just 4% year on year in the last two weeks of June. T&E and restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully, but we have seen some improvement, especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend. The most significant improvement we saw was in retail with a strong recovery in card-present volume in the second half of the quarter and consistently strong growth in card-not-present volume throughout the quarter. More recently, we've seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out, notably in both states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases. We continue to see larger year-on-year declines in states that remain partially closed, particularly those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.




 In terms of consumers' demand for credit, we observed similar recovery trends. In Auto, April saw the lowest level of loan and lease originations since the financial crisis. But activity rebounded sharply in May and June. And in fact, June ended up the best month for auto originations in our history. And in home lending, retail purchase applications, after reaching a low in April, recovered to well above pre-COVID levels in June due to a strong and broad market recovery. Continuing on the topic of consumer behavior, let's turn to Page 3 for an update on what we're seeing around our customer assistance program. Relative to the peak levels we observed at the beginning of April, we've seen a significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter. To date, we have provided customer assistance for nearly 1.7 million accounts, representing $79 billion of balances across both our owned and serviced portfolios. And of those accounts, a large percentage having made at least one payment while in the forbearance period, just over 50% in both card and home lending. In terms of early reenrollment trends. In card, only a small portion of our customers have completed both the initial 90-day deferral period and reached a payment date, but the majority of those customers resumed payments, with less than 20% of accounts requesting additional assistance. And then in home lending, of those whose forbearance period expired in June, most have either been extended at the customer's request or auto enrolled into new three month forbearances, with approximately 40% of the extension still current. And so while we're following this data closely, it's still too early to draw any conclusions. Now moving on to Page 4 for some more detail about our second-quarter results. We recorded revenue of $33.8 billion which was up $4.3 billion or 15% year on year. While net interest income was down approximately $600 million or 4% on lower rates, mostly offset by higher markets NII and balance sheet growth, noninterest revenue was up $4.9 billion or 33% predominantly driven by CIB, markets and IBCs.




 Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $700 million or 4% year on year on revenue-related expenses partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses. This quarter, credit costs were $10.5 billion including a net reserve build of $8.9 billion and net charge-offs of $1.6 billion. Let's turn to Page 5 for more detail on the reserve build. Our net reserve build of $8.9 billion for the quarter consists of $4.6 billion in wholesale and $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly card. The reserve increase in the first quarter was predicated on an acute but short-lived downturn with a solid recovery in the second half of the year. And while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent weeks, there does continue to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery. At the bottom of the page, you can see our updated base case. But remember, this is just one of five scenarios we use to derive our allowance for credit losses. Our build is based on the weighted outcome of these scenarios and assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower GDP recovery and an unemployment rate that remains in the double digits through the first half of 2021. In addition to the obvious impact on consumer, this protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad-based impact across wholesale sectors than we assumed in the first quarter. Given the increased uncertainty of the macroeconomic outlook, how customer payment behavior will play out and the future of government stimulus and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both consumers and wholesale clients, we've put more meaningful weight on the downside scenario this quarter. And so therefore, we're prepared and have reserved for something worse than the base case. And given CECL covers life of loan, if our assumptions are realized, we wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 6. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4% which is over 100 basis points above our new SCB-based minimum of 11.3%. And just to touch on SLR, while our reported ratio is 6.8%, it's worth noting that we're not going to rely on temporary relief.




 And so without that, our ratio is 5.7%. As we said in late June, unless things change meaningfully, the board intends to maintain the $0.90 dividend in the third quarter. Given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes on why we're comfortable saying that including the value of our strong and steady earnings stream as well as how we're managing our capital through this crisis. So with that, let's go to Page 7. It's an obvious point, but it's worth a reminder that since 2018, our average quarterly PPNR of over $13 billion has been generating over 60 basis points of new CET1 capacity per quarter, even after having made meaningful investments in our businesses. This powerful earnings stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our customers and clients when they need us most, and it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly replenish in times of stress. While over the last two and a half years, we've paid out approximately 100% of cumulative earnings, distributing nearly $75 billion of excess capital, we're now building a significant amount of capital since we've suspended our share repurchases. And we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe scenarios which you can see on Page 8. Standing here today, we have $34 billion of reserves and $191 billion of CET1 capital, of which $16 billion is excess over and above our regulatory buffers. Our 3.3% SCB translates to $51 billion of capital that is available to prefund stress at any time. And on top of that, our three and a half percent GSIB surcharge translates to another $54 billion. All that, so our $69 billion regulatory minimum is never touched. And as you know, we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios, and one of them is the extremely adverse scenario that Jamie discussed in his shareholder letter earlier this year. We've updated this analysis, and it now assumes an even deeper contraction of GDP, down nearly 14% at the end of 2020 versus 4Q '19 and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly 22%. Even under this scenario, we estimate that we would end the year with a CET1 ratio above 10%, and we would be bound by advanced, so our regulatory minimum would be 10 and a half percent. While we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers, this scenario would require us to do so, but notably only to a small extent.




 It's also worth noting that based on the limited information provided from the Fed about their U and W scenarios, we believe that our extremely adverse scenario simulates an even worse path for the economy over the next 12 months. And even if we get this wrong and our losses are twice as high, we still wouldn't use the entire SCB. Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Yes, so this is Jamie. I'd just like to amplify a couple of these points. So we're showing this example. Obviously, it's predicated on a lot of assumptions which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just simply to show that we can bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an extreme adverse which roughly may equate to the U or W of the Fed, and we're going to do a lot more analysis than that because obviously we need to be prepared for that. We dip into advanced CET1, but that's because we're taking no actions. So I've always told you that advanced capital is very pro-cyclical.




 So as things get downgraded, your RWA goes way up. Your capital base doesn't change that much, but the RWA goes way up. And there will be lots of actions we would take that we can avoid that from taking place whatsoever. The other thing I want to point out is this extreme adverse probably can't happen in one quarter. It'll happen in several quarters. Because we really know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like that. So even if the economy starts to head there, it'll take us a couple of quarters before you make the determination that that has a 100% possibility. So remember, this is saying we now believe it's 100%. Now of course, things could be worse, by the way. But we're just trying to show you how much capital the company does have. And the dividend, now I'm going to be -- it sounds like I'm going to contradict myself. I am not, OK? Today, we have all of that PPNR, all of that earnings, all of the things. So it would be kind of be foolish to guess the future of extreme adverse and cut your dividend because we can easily get through very, very tough times and never cut the dividend. However, if you enter something like an extreme adverse, all of a sudden, you have new scenarios which are even worse. You don't know. So at one point, the board would consider cutting the dividend because things can get even worse than extreme adverse, and we want to be able to handle anything out there.




 The primary concern of the company to serve our clients, serve our community through thick or thin, and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So there's no intent to do it, but if things get really bad, and we use the word materially and significantly, that's something we should look at. The other thing by the way is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses. They're not the CCAR type of stuff. You all are doing estimates that show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not lose that kind of money on credit, OK? And on the next page, Jen is going to explain some stuff. I'm going to make a few slight, additional comments. I also want you to -- and she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think temporary is a funny thing to go into a crisis. And you could use it for a while, but it disappears on March 1 or February 1. So -- and my view is we shouldn't rely on anything like that.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 And I'll just add, Jamie, to the point on advanced RWA. If you look on the slide, and you can see we travel from 13.1% to 10.4%. About half of that is just the RWA increasing and the other half is the loan is increasing. So anyway, as Jamie said, moving on to Page 9. All of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework that still has opportunities for recalibration. So while we've talked about this for years, it has perhaps never been more important. I'll start with CCAR, and Jamie just made this point, but it is not predictive of what we actually think would happen. And the best example of this might be the global market shock. It is a significant portion of the SCB, and we've obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of 2020. So we continue to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework including the points we've previously made about GSIB. These changes would foster a higher pace of economic growth over time without compromising financial stability.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yup. So again, I do emphasize a couple of things here. So look, the point of CCAR was that banks can handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of what your results might be. So all the CCAR tests roughly equate to a global financial crisis. And all the CCAR tests always have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing nine quarters. But in the ensuing nine quarters after Lehman, we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a quarter. We take actions, we're diversified, we've got streams of earnings. And so I'm not -- we're not against CCAR because that's protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst, but that's not necessarily predictive. The global market shock which I think they have is $25 billion in counterparty losses again just to be instructive of that, in '08, '09, you had Fannie Mae go bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt, you had Bear Sterns effectively, you had Lehman Brothers effectively, you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in Europe, tons of counterparty failures. And our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of $4 billion, not $25 billion. And of course, it was quickly made back because, as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading, spreads gap out. And then all of a sudden, you're making more money trading because you -- and you have recoveries in position. So the stress capital buffer of 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose. And so -- and I hope over time, we can drive that down by taking real actions to a number closer to 2.5%.




 GSIB itself, I pointed out before, I'm not against the concept of big banks and more capital. But GSIB is -- it's not the same as CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strength, your earnings, your PPNR and things like that. GSIB does not. It's just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It doesn't include diversification. It doesn't include margins. It doesn't include actions. It doesn't include -- and it's just really not representative at all that I would say is risk of a company or something like that. And so we have enough capital to handle a lot of stuff which is we've always run the company that way. We've always run the company so that we can handle adverse times because in my short lifetime, I've seen crises over and over and over. We're not predicting them, we're just prepared for them. So I'll stop there.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thank you. All right. So let's go on to the businesses. So we'll start on Page 10 with Consumer & Community Banking. So CCB reported a net loss of $176 million including reserve build of $4.6 billion. Revenue of $12.2 billion was down 9% year on year driven by deposit margin compression, lower transaction activity and customer relief partially offset by strong deposit growth and home lending margin expansion. Deposit margin was down 108 basis points year on year on a sharp decline in rates, but deposit growth was a record 20% year on year, up over $130 billion. We would estimate that approximately 50% of that growth is COVID-related due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses, lower consumer spending and tax payment delays. Mobile users were up 10% year on year. And since the start of the pandemic, we've seen increased levels of digital engagement. For example, quick deposit enrollment is up two times pre-COVID levels.




 As I noted earlier, for consumer lending, the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that continued to evolve. Auto loan and lease originations were down 9% year on year due to the exit of the Mazda partnership. Excluding this impact, auto originations were up mid-single digits. And while the home lending market was favorable, home lending total originations were down 1% year on year driven by a decline in correspondent volume, substantially offset by an increase in retail volume. Total CCB loans were down 7% year on year driven by home lending down 14% due to prior loan sales and card down 7% on lower spend, offset by business banking, up 59% due to PPP originations. Expenses of $6.6 billion were down 3% driven by lower travel-related benefits, structural and marketing expenses. And lastly, credit cost included the $4.6 billion reserve build I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion driven by card. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 11. CIB reported net income of $5.5 billion and an ROE of 27% on revenue of $16.4 billion. investment banking revenue of $3.4 billion was up 91% year on year, largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets as well as the gains on our bridge book which were primarily a function of improved market conditions. IB fees for the quarter were an all-time record, up 54% year on year. We maintained our No. 1 rank and grew our market share to 9.8% for the first half of the year. In advisory, we were up 15% driven by the closing of a few notable transactions. Debt underwriting fees were up 55%. We maintained our No.




 1 rank in overall wallet, and we're the leaders and the lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 93%, and we grew share by approximately 200 basis points relative to the first quarter. With regards to outlook, we expect third quarter IB fees to be down, both sequentially and year on year, due to the usual seasonal declines and lower M&A announcements year-to-date. And if the economy begins to stabilize, we expect capital markets to revert to normal levels. However, any sustained period of instability could result in additional demand for liquidity and therefore increased capital markets activity. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79% year on year, an all-time record driven by strong performance throughout the quarter, and it was only later in June that activity began to revert to more normal levels. We saw strength across products and regions from both flow trading and large episodic transactions. While strong client activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme, our market-making activity this quarter benefited from improved market liquidity, and we were able to better monetize flows. Fixed income was up 99% year on year or 120% adjusted for the gain from the IPO of Tradeweb last year driven by very active primary and secondary markets across products, particularly in macro. Equities was up 38% largely driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash. Looking forward, we expect the slowdown that we started to see toward the end of June to continue. In addition, the second half of last year was very strong, making any year-on-year comparison difficult. But obviously, the environment makes forecasting markets performance even more challenging than usual. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3% year on year primarily driven by a reporting reclassification in merchant services. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year on year as continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volume and higher average deposit balances.




 Credit adjustments and other was a gain of $510 million as I mentioned upfront driven by the tightening of funding spreads on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 19% compared to the prior year due to revenue-related expenses. Finally, credit costs of $2 billion reflects the net reserve build I referred to earlier. Now moving on to commercial banking on Page 12. commercial banking reported a net loss of $691 million which included reserve build of approximately $2.4 billion. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 5% year on year driven by higher deposits and loans and equity investment gain and higher investment banking revenue, largely offset by lower deposit NII. Record gross investment banking revenues of $851 million were up 44% year on year due to increased bonds and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $899 million were down 3% year on year driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $237 billion were up 41% year on year as the increase in balances for March has largely remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this environment. End-of-period loans were up 7% year on year but down 4% quarter on quarter. C&I loans were down 7% quarter on quarter as revolver utilization, while still elevated, has declined significantly from the all-time highs in March. However, this was partially offset by the impact of PPP loans. CRE loans were flat with generally lower originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. Credit cost of $2.4 billion included the reserve build mentioned earlier and $79 million of net charge-offs, roughly half of which were in oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on Page 13. asset and wealth management reported net income of $658 million with pre-tax margin and ROE of 24%.




 Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was up 1% year on year as growth in average deposit and loan balances, along with higher brokerage activity, were largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.5 billion were down 3% year on year with lower structural as well as volume and revenue-related expenses partially offset by continued investments in advisors. Credit costs were $223 million driven by the reserve build that I mentioned earlier. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $29 billion, positive across all channels and all regions, led by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity inflows of $95 billion, making us the No. 1 institutional money manager globally. AUM of $2.5 trillion and overall client assets of $3.4 trillion, up 15% and 12% year on year, respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, deposits were up 20% year on year on growth in interest-bearing products; and loans were up 12%, with strength in both wholesale and Mortgage Lending. Now on to corporate on Page 14. Corporate reported a net loss of $568 million. Revenue was a loss of $754 million, down $1.1 billion year on year driven by lower net interest income on lower rates including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities. And expenses of $147 million was down $85 million year on year. Now let's turn to Page 15 for the outlook. You'll see here that despite the uncertain environment, our latest full-year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance. Based on the latest implies, we expect net interest income to be approximately $56 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65 billion which is slightly higher than expected previously reflecting the outperformance in the second quarter and will ultimately be an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year. So to wrap up.




 Against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment, our second-quarter performance highlighted the benefits of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company. While the range of outcomes is broader than ever before, our priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on supporting our employees, customers, clients and communities around the globe and on being good stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders. I'd like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the front lines of this crisis and our people here at JPMorgan Chase, who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and dedication through these times. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Good morning Jen and Jamie. Jen, I was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your commercial exposures to heavily COVID-impacted sectors across CRE and C&I, so thinking oil and gas, travel, retail. Just to help us understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve-building was directed toward this quarter.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So I'll start by saying most impacted sectors, like the ones that you mentioned, represents about a third of our overall exposure. More than half of that is investment-grade and two-thirds of the noninvestment-grade is secured. And in terms of the second-quarter downgrades -- well first, I'd say in the first quarter, when we were really looking at a deep but short-lived downturn, we were really very much focused on the most impacted sectors.




 And now that we're looking at a more protracted downturn, we're reserved for a much more broad-based impact across sectors. So just to put that in context, the second-quarter reserve build, about 40% of that is in the most impacted sectors versus two-thirds of the build in the first quarter was the most impacted sectors. And then in terms of the downgrades that we saw in the second quarter, less than a third of those were in the most impacted sectors.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst And just for your definition of most impacted sectors, what would you be including in that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Consumer and retail, oil and gas, real estate, retail and lodging and subsectors as you think about real estate.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK, and just a quick follow-up question. You maintained the NII outlook for the year despite a pretty big drop in net interest margin. Could you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for NII and maybe how trading NII might play into the thinking?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. It's a great question, and you're spot on which is markets helps NII. So the outperformance in markets helps NII, but can be a headwind on NIM, just given that the NIM is below the average. So yes, it was -- maintaining that outlook did have something to do with the outperformance of markets. You're right.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Jennifer, just to kick off on the question. On Page 3, you went through a lot of detail around the forbearance that you've been given and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during the deferral period. Could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that you've outlined? In your base case, what are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So I won't go into specific details, but I'll just say a couple of things which is, it is still too early to really read a whole lot into what we're seeing. The visibility here remains low I would say given the amount of support that is out there. But you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk, given that they are in forbearance program. So we did account for that as we thought about our reserves.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah, OK. Because I'm thinking, all right, you've got the inverse of the right-hand column could be construed as what should be expected to become delinquencies over time. And I'm wondering, as a follow-up question, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that, if your assumptions are realized, that you could be basically close to fully reserved for this cycle. Maybe you could give us a sense as to which assumptions you're talking about because I know you're expecting an outcome that's worse than your base case. So I was just a little confused about what I should assume your base case is and what assumptions you're pointing to that, if realized, you're done on the reserving.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So first of all, there are a lot of assumptions, given, as I said, the visibility is still quite low. So assumptions around the economic outlook, and I'll come back to that, assumptions around consumer payment behavior and then assumptions around stimulus. So going back to the economic outlook, we have five different scenarios. We did lean in more heavily to the downside scenarios relative to what we would have otherwise done. Even the Fed has put equal weight on downside scenarios in their base case. So we certainly thought having a conservative bias there was the prudent thing to do. And so as you look at that Slide 5, that is just the base case. So you can see there exiting this year just under 11%. When you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the five scenarios, we end up with double-digit unemployment through the first half of 2021 versus what you see on Page 5 there, is just the base case which shows some improvement relative to the fourth quarter, getting down to just under 8% by the end of 2021.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Betsy, so I just clarify. The base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli's or JPMorgan or the Fed estimates for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are all these assumptions about stimulus and PPP and all these other things. But that is the base case, and we're reserved more than that. So therefore, if the base case happens, we may be over-reserved. I hope the base case happens.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Me too.OperatorOur next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport.Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities LLC -- Analyst




 Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the consumer and delinquencies. Obviously, you had an impact from deferral programs, and delinquencies actually -- 30-day delinquencies were actually down. Can you talk to what you're seeing in the nondeferral programs? It doesn't seem like we're seeing much stress at all, even in early stage delinquencies. What would you attribute that to? And what are you seeing in your nondeferral programs?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I mean, simply, I would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus. And so as I said, the visibility on what we're dealing with is very, very low because we're not seeing right now what you would typically expect to see given a recession. And so the way we have to think about reserving is all about the outlook because we're not actually seeing it today. And so Jamie has said this many times.




 May and June will prove to be the easy bumps in terms of this recovery. And now we're really hitting the moment of truth I think in the months ahead.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah and just to amplify it. In the normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charge-offs go up, home prices go down, none of that's true here, incomes go down, savings go down. Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So you will see the effect of this recession, you're just not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus, and in fact, 60% or 70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working. So it's just very peculiar times.




Jim Mitchell -- Seaport Global Securities LLC -- Analyst Yup. No, that's fair. Maybe a follow-up on DFAST. Jamie, you made comments about the market shock, and we kind of went through a market shock, and everyone's trading held up quite well. Do you see that changing the Fed's view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book or is it -- or you don't think that's too optimistic?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 I don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not -- what they're looking at is they're making sure a bank can withstand the bad -- as if they were all the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for things happy and good, so I'm not against that concept. I just want to say, if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong, what happens to your trading or something like that? And they do the same assumptions like outflows. The outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis. But they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that.OperatorOur next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.




Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Quick question on the balance sheet. I mean obviously there's tremendous balance sheet growth as liquidity built up in the quarter. But how are we thinking about that on a go-forward basis? Is that expected to roll off over the next couple of quarters? Is that kind of persistent and expected to stick around, and you're just going to be operating with a much larger balance sheet in the near term?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So I'll start with deposits. I mean, in the first quarter, it was very much a wholesale story, and we said we expect it to normalize, and we have seen that. We started to see that. So looking ahead on wholesale, I think there are puts and takes. We'll continue to see revolvers paid down, Securities Services will likely continue to normalize. I think tailwinds for deposits, Fed balance sheet expansion will be slower but will continue. And we do think we'll continue to see organic growth on the consumer side, probably down from here on tax payments as well as a pickup in consumer spending. But in both cases, I think we'll continue to see very, very strong year-on-year growth, both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this year. And then in terms of balance sheet management, I mean, we manage the balance sheet across multiple dimensions, NII, liquidity, capital and interest rate risk. And so we have had $400 billion of deposit growth since the end of last year. And when you consider, as you know, that some of that growth is likely to be transitory and deployment opportunities have been diminished given the rate environment, we have held a decent amount of that in cash. However, we did add about $88 billion in securities here in the second quarter. And on the deposit side, we've been very disciplined on pay rates.




Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst So if those deposits have grown, we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into securities or are you looking to fund loans on those?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it's going to end up in deposits. And for the most part, those deposits are going to be securities because the loan growth usually going to recession doesn't go up that much.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. We should see -- as consumer spending recovers, we should see some growth in card which will help us. But we'll have PPP starting to pay down, and as Jamie said, loan growth but likely slower.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'd just point out that look at the big numbers. We have over $1 trillion between cash held at the Central Bank which is close to $400 billion, $500 billion; treasuries which is close to several hundred billion; and other very liquid assets, mostly good securities, that's $1 trillion. So when people look at the safety and soundness of an institution like this, that is a tremendous sum of money. Some is required.




 We are required to hold a lot of liquidity, but some of it just because we're investing conservatively. Thanks.OperatorOur next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some charge-offs. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance. But what are your assumptions in terms of when charge-offs start going up, maybe where they peak, and how long they stay at that level?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer It's really difficult to know. I mean, first, we have to start seeing delinquencies. And so later this year, but next year will be much heavier on charge-offs as you think about realizing the assumptions that we've made in the reserves. It's very -- it's difficult to know.




 The good thing is CECL is life of loan, so we feel well-covered for the scenarios that we're looking at.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And then remind us, you are seeing some creep in the nonperforming assets. Obviously, it's off low levels, but they are starting to go up. And remind us why that's not starting to feed into net charge-offs. Or is this just a timing issue and will in the next quarter or two?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. When you look at the nonaccrual increase in wholesale, half of that is one client. So it's really -- I wouldn't draw any conclusions from that. And as you say, it's creeping up off of very low levels. So again, we still aren't seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Hi. Just more on the reserve question. So if the Fed's base case is achieved, then you are over reserved. If your base case assumptions which...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We hope. We hope we're over-reserved. OK.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst OK. And if your base case assumptions which are more conservative, are realized, then OK, you're done with the reserve-building. And if it's worse, then you'll have to add more reserves. But since the end of the quarter, we're seeing an increase in COVID cases in Florida, in Texas, in California and elsewhere. And isn't there a link between an increase in COVID cases with death, with economic activity or how do you think about that? And I'm staring at Slide 2 and I can't get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales volume. And it seems like it's flattening off here in June. So just since the end of the quarter, if you were to kind of mark-to-mark your thinking -- mark-to-market your thinking as of this second with what's happening, do you feel better, worse or the same versus the end of the quarter as it relates to your assumptions?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 So can I just -- we feel exactly the same today that we did at the end of the quarter, that's sort of mark-to-market. And Mike, we were very clear, we cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We're also very clear that -- and I know at least I think, you're going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June. And that we -- you have to be prepared for that. You're going to have a lot of ins and outs. You're going to have people getting scared about COVID. They're going to get scared about the economy, small businesses, big companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So it's just going to be murky which is why if you look at the base case, an adverse case, an extreme adverse case, they're all possible, and we're just guessing at the probabilities of those things. That's all what we're doing. We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. And this -- the word unprecedented is rarely used properly. This time, it's being used properly. It's unprecedented what's going on around the world.




 And obviously, COVID itself is a main attribute. So the Fed's W case, they made it very clear. Their W case is that COVID comes back in a big way in the fall and you have to shut down the economy again. And obviously, we've got to be prepared for that too. We don't know the probability of that. We simply don't know, by the way, awaking time, I'm guessing.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And I would just add, Mike, just to clarify, that we are reserved for something worse than the base case. And for all the reasons you said, they informed our decision to lean in a bit more on the downside scenarios. And so while there is a bit of a -- we hope, a conservative bias here, this does represent our best estimate based upon everything we know which does include the sort of slowdown that you referenced in terms of more recent activity.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst All right. And my follow-up would be kind of the flip side. During this very difficult time, you've grown deposits over the past year equal to the fifth-largest bank. I mean, the deposit growth is kind of off the charts here. So you said half of that is due to COVID, but is the other half due to share gains? So I guess there's several questions in that. But how much of that is related to digital banking, and how much of that do you expect to go away once this crisis has passed?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So I talked a little bit about kind of how we're thinking about deposits looking forward. Also, I'd just clarify, Mike, when we said 50% COVID-related, that was on the consumer side. And so that, we do think some of that will leave with tax payments and consumer spending coming back. And then in terms of how much of it is share gain, it's difficult to know at this point. Historically, we have performed well in lower rate environments. And I think you're right. I think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch footprint and our people and all the things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this.OperatorOur next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. The first question is for Jamie. A lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are encouraged by the fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions which you've proven today, but are hesitant about bank stocks, given the overhang of the DFAST resubmissions in the fourth quarter and what that could imply for the dividend. And I guess, I just -- I know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering, under the scenario that you see playing out and relative to that 60 basis points of CET1 generation per quarter, what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of that extreme adverse case?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 That it's completely sustainable. And if you -- if we enter the extreme adverse case, the board should and will consider reducing it. And like I pointed out, the FEMA adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend. The reason they would consider reducing it is because once you enter like 14% or 15% unemployment, you don't know the future. So now you're going to have another extreme adverse case which is going to be 20% unemployment. And therefore, you would protect yourself from that, and cutting the dividend is cheap equity. And so the goal is to sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers, it's completely minuscule relative quarter-by-quarter. So this decision can be made as you enter these things. And we're all hoping the base case happens.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 And just as a quick follow-up. We also got this question from investors. In the extreme adverse case, is there a preference toward cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension or is there a difference between the two?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There's no difference between the two. If you cut your dividend, you're going to hopefully put it back when the time comes and -- but a temporary suspension just sounds peculiar. It's a suspension. And I've done that twice in my life. It's a prudent thing to do, and if you might need that capital going forward because things are going to get that terrible or something like that. But the other thing, and you can ask the other question. If the base case happens, we're going to end up with far too much capital generation, and we'll start buying back stock again which I hope we can do before it goes way up.




OperatorOur next question is...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So I don't -- we don't expect that this year. But I wouldn't completely rule it out in the fourth quarter.




OperatorAnd our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi Glenn.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hello there. Question for you. So we've had this big market rebound in the overall markets, and that's led to a lot of revenue. But given this outlook and the uncertain path that we've been talking through this whole time, I'm curious on ways you think about potentially derisking on balance sheet. Now some of it is just this huge liquidity buildup is a derisked balance sheet, I get that. But are there proactive things you can do to reduce the high-leverage RWA in a more stressed environment? Have you been selling into this recovery is I guess my question.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 I'll take it.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Go ahead.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So I guess there's two components to it which is the investment securities portfolio, and then proactive things we can do on RWA. If that answers your question, Glenn. I'll start with investment securities. We are being cautious, and we have opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure there over the second quarter. And then on RWA, we are -- because we're preparing for a range of outcomes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about, if we needed to, what could we do? But it is sort of a last resort because we certainly don't want to have any impact on clients and customers. And so we're ready. We're looking at it, but we haven't done anything I would say proactively at this point. We're very much focused on helping clients and customers get through this crisis.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So let me -- let me answer this way. On the consumer side, we, like other banks you've seen, are kind of prudent tightening up with how you do credit. That's already happened. And obviously, you could do some more.




 But Jen, you had some great numbers about how good credit is. Like, I think the -- give those FICO numbers you gave me the other day.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer The FICO number.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Well then, how much better home lending is?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Oh, that was that on the LTV? The weighted average LTV?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yeah. LTV, yeah.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I mean, it's really extraordinary. And I was in mortgage, so I should have remembered, but I did have to ask. In 2010, our weighted average LTV on the portfolio in home lending was 90%, and it's now at 56%.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Right. And you can assume it's better in credit cards, it's better in auto, we have less subprime. That's the consumer side. On the lending -- on the business side, we've always been prudent. We're always very tight and careful and stuff like that. Usually, what happens in downturns like this, you get a little more serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital. So a lot of these companies have been raising a lot of capital. On the investment side, and this is kind of a peculiarity of accounting again, we can actually make it more conservative, putting securities into healthy maturity which we've done very little of and I'm going to consider it. I don't personally understand why that reduces risk, but it does reduce your SCB, and maybe we'll do that over time. But the security portfolios are pretty prudent there. And in trading, it's every day. So trading is -- just think of trading at Daniel and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day managing those risks and those exposures. And you could assume that they're managing it very, very well and tightly today. And we certainly are not punting for fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious and serve our clients. And so yes, you are more conservative.




 And reducing RWA, yes, we can -- if we wanted to, we could start doing that by all these various things.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thanks. One quickie on the consumer side. I'm curious if you've had -- we're now four months into the bulk of the lockdown in the United States. And some of your branches have been either closed or drive-up only. And I'm -- and we're watching your deposits grow like a weed. So I'm curious if you've learned any lessons that might change your thoughts on the branch network, on your organic growth efforts, as we go forward and come out of this some day.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So first of all, the deposit numbers, deposits went up because of PPP. Deposits went up because of the payroll checks that people got. Deposits went up, the revolvers are taken down by $50 billion, something like that -- or something like that. Almost of all that end up in deposits. And of course, a lot of that's already reversed and stuff like that. So you got to look at both sides of that, and -- but you were going to say something, Jen?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 I was just going to add on -- I mean, there's -- of course, we're learning a lot. I mean, I mentioned the quick deposit enrollment. But we haven't learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around branch expansion. In fact, we just opened our 100th branch in market expansion. So we're really excited about that. We think we'll open probably another 75 this year. So we'll be nearly halfway to the 400 branches that we've talked about in market expansion. And so we'll see. We do have -- still have about 1,000 branches that are closed. And it's possible that we learn something that helps us think about accelerating de-densification or consolidation, but it will be at the margin. And we're not going to make any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we have the benefit over time of watching our customer behavior so they can really be the ones that inform our strategy.Operator




Our next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- LLC Yes. Good morning. Two questions. One, on Page 6, you give the SLR ratio as adjusted for the temporary relief programs on the capital. Wonder if you had a similar ratio for CET1. And part of that question would also be which would be the more confined ratio starting next March?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There's no temporary relief in CET1.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer CET1, the only -- and I'm not even trying to call it relief. There's a phase-in on CECL, but it's over many years. And so I don't necessarily think about that as temporary like SLR. SLR, at this point, the -- it is temporary.




 It is due to expire in the first quarter of next year which is why we're very focused on managing that without big exclusions.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And both -- we manage them both. I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage, so it's something like 20 different capital and liquidity ratios.Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- LLC




 And Jamie, FSOC is meeting today behind closed doors. If I understand, there are two topics. One has to do with mortgage -- secondary mortgage market liquidity, and the other with the COVID stress test overlay. Do you have any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't. The COVID, I mean, you could be -- you obviously have some insights, right? I don't have -- the COVID obviously we're going to run the new stress test. We're going to run it and we're going to look at all the Fed cases, U, W and stuff like that, because they laid it out, perfectly reasonable that people would refer to that kind of stress test. I think the mortgage market is a different issue, OK? And we've been very consistent that mortgages, believe it or not, are more -- far more costly than they should be. Normally, you'd be looking at -- if you looked at the 10-year rate which is what, 60 basis points, the mortgage take should be 1.6% or 1.8% instead of 3.3%. The cost of -- the reason for that is because the cost of servicing and origination is so high, it's obviously got to be passed through. It's high because there's an enormous amount of rules and regulation put in place, that a lot do not create safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basically 80% LTV, verified peoples' incomes, making sure you're doing the right kind of stuff.




 And the second one is because it's a very no-securitization market. The securitization market is important because it reduces your risk-weighted asset, and it puts more incentive for banks to put on their balance sheet. And the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So we -- I think they should change that. They should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency mortgages which are even more -- a lot more expensive than agency mortgages. So once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change Reg A, B a little bit of that of all things, you're going to have a much better market. The cost of mortgages will come down, and they will particularly come down for people at the lower end. I mean, so this should be phased, and it should be phased right away.Operator




Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I have a broader question. And I just want to get your perspectives on public policy and banks. And it was a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress test. And I know banks are working hard to be part of the solution this time and not part of the problem, but we're also having more open discussions about things like inequality and social justice which, in my opinion, are long overdue. But I worry that fair or not, banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those issues. And I think you see that in things like the mainstream press' depictions of big banks and PPP and stuff like that. And I'm just curious if you are concerned at all about populist anti-bank policies gaining traction, however you want to define them, whether it's breaking up the banks, directed lending, rate capture or whatever, in a pretty polarized political environment or do you think I'm being too alarmist or overly concerned about stuff that is pretty unlikely in our country? So I just kind of want to get your perspective just generally on how banks fit into the overall policy and political backdrop.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let me just -- the things you got to do every single day when you go to work is to do the right thing for the right reason, serve your customers, and we try to do this. We tried very hard to take care of our employees, to train people. We tried very hard to advance black lead into the company and finance and others. And of course, we make mistakes. And so I understand some of the angst out there. But we try to do the best we can. We get involved in policy, like this mortgage thing, that would be better for Americans. And we understand that there's -- people want banks to help America, and we do. The most important thing we could do is be a healthy and vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients. And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So very often, we hear that banks should do more of that.




 No, irresponsible stuff is irresponsible. It will lead to bad outcomes. And that's kind of what happened last time around. So we try to do it right, and we try to listen very carefully when there's criticism, and sometimes and often legitimate, about what we could have done better or should do better or try to be better in the future.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst OK. OK. That's helpful. I guess, as broad as that question was, I'm going to ask a very narrow question for Jen and -- on your NII guidance. Does that -- I presume that includes gains on PPP fees for unforgiven loans. And have you quantified that or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude of those figures could be?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So we've been really clear on PPP which is that we don't intend to profit from PPP. That doesn't mean that you won't have some geography issues. So you'll have some revenue and then you'll have expenses, and the profit will be near zero. It is an immaterial amount this quarter, given these fees are recognized over the lives of the loans. So it's very little this quarter, both revenue and expenses. And looking out, you'll see -- we'll see more of that probably in the third and fourth quarter. Again, they -- it will still be zero on the bottom line. And even the gross numbers won't be meaningful in the grand scheme of things.Operator




Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning Jen. Can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you talked about? How often do you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify the corporate loans? And second, you touched on earlier in a question about some of the COVID-related sectors that are being impacted because of what we're going through. Can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within that COVID group that you mentioned?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So first on the reclassification. We mentioned it was a geography issue in merchant services, but it didn't have to be...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There was no reclassification of wholesale loans.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yeah. Yeah. And then in terms of the most impacted, I mean, they are the ones that you would expect to see around travel, oil and gas and real estate and retail. So it's the sectors that you would expect to see. Although as I said earlier, and it's important to note, that for the downgrades that we experienced in the second quarter, less than a third of them were in the most impacted industries. So really, this is -- we're seeing this as being much more broad-based.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. And then second, and I may have missed this, I apologize. But in your Slide 3, you gave us very good detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio. Do you have any numbers on the commercial and corporate portfolios that -- loans that might be in forbearance? And is it more commercial real estate or C&I?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. They're just not meaningful numbers, would have included them had they been. So I'll just go back to what we said which is we're just not seeing what you would typically see.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer But these have been nonperforming.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer They end up in nonperforming...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We don't have a category in wholesale or commercial the same way you have a category in consumer.




OperatorAnd our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the points in slides you made about capital and long-term opportunities for recalibration. First I guess will you have any dialogue with the Fed about the 3.3% SCB as some other banks have mentioned? And then secondly, where do you think we stand on the GSIB recalibration, to your points about systemic risk not -- that shouldn't impact a bank's balance sheet?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We're not going to go back to the Fed and the 3.3%. But obviously, we're going to look at why 3.3%? And we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit because we know we have another CCAR coming up in a couple of months, so there's no reason for us to go through extensive amount of work as opposed to fixed what's already there. And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needed a lot of recalibration. But there are things they should have recalibrated for already which is America gold-plated it which I think is wholly unnecessary. They should have taken cash and treasuries and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. And obviously, it goes way up when the Fed does things like they're doing recently. And they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or growth in the shadow banking system which they were supposed to do. So I'm just hoping they go about and do that at one point. But these things get so wrapped up and political. People politicize very complicated calculations which I thought kind of peculiar and funny. But my view is if they do the numbers, they should do them right, and they're just not right anymore.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yup. And the second question is just going back to Slide 3. You lay out the percent of accounts on this page. Auto seems to be the biggest, and then in the supplement on Page 13, the balances seem to imply a bigger percent on deferral. Just can you talk a little bit about the differences there? And then why do you think you're seeing more accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes? Thank you.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 OK. I don't actually know the answer to reconciling the supplement to Slide 3. So Jason and team can follow-up with you on that one.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Maybe then just a comment about auto on deferrals. And why do -- what do you think you're seeing in that customer base versus others? And do you think that means anything different for forward credit trends?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 No.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer No, yeah.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




 OK. Thanks very much.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.. -- Analyst




 Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. I guess, I just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising. Dealogic shows over $2 trillion of debt and equity raised in the quarter. And I guess a two-part question around that. One is, as you look at that, was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas, and presumably, capital that's junior to your bank debt? And to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank loans? And then secondly, looking forward, I mean, did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital do so in the second quarter? And therefore, we're looking at a kind of a flat spot going forward or do you see this as kind of like there's an ongoing need for a lot of these companies to continue to raise capital?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think, first of all, it was across the board. I mean, you saw our strong companies, weaker companies, high-yield markets opened up, converts. I'd put converts and equity in there too. People did a lot of capital-raising.




 I think it was wise. I think a lot of people said they prefunded a lot of their capital needs to make sure they get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that. So I don't think it would be like it was before. So it will definitely come down, but I still think there's opportunity for some people to prefund some of that. But it is prefunding. This is not capital. All this capital is not being raised to go spend. It's being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you're prepared for whatever comes next. And you've heard a lot of companies make statements, and you guys got to go through it yourself about, we've got two years of cash, we've got three years of cash. We've got -- people want to be prepared, and I think it's appropriate. But just for your models, we don't expect revenues in investment banking. They will normalize or even come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out. At one point, we can't predict month-by-month exactly. And for trading, because no one asked, cut it in half. Cut it in half. And that will probably be closer to the future than if you say it's going to still be double what it normally runs.




OperatorAnd our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer This is the last question.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I think they're quite straightforward. I just wanted some clarity really on the nature of CECL provisioning. And obviously, you've made some very big provisions based on much more conservative assumptions. But the nature of CECL provision is obviously should mean that in a third quarter, if your assumptions do not change, then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second quarter to a much more normal level. And I just wanted to see how you thought about that for the third quarter.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So I would start by saying where we are right now, while there's a conservative bias to where we are right now, it is our best estimate of what we're facing. We certainly hope that in the future, we look back on this as a conservative moment. But this is our best estimate. And so if our assumptions are realized, and again, our reserve reflects something worse than the base case. So if that's realized, then we shouldn't see meaningful reserve build in the third quarter or if that continues to be in the third quarter.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking -- Analyst Right. Yes. So I mean, context, would it be similar to quarters that we've seen in 2019, for example?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. You have reserves for growth, but not for the crisis per se.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking -- Analyst Yes, exactly, exactly. That's very clear. Thanks for that. And then on the CIB trading environment obviously we saw June and we've seen a bit of it July.




 Would you say that's normalized so that we were a level consistent with what we've seen with 2019 or are you still seeing some pretty strong trading following through into the second quarter -- sorry, into the third quarter?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I just answered that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know. It's only a couple of weeks into this thing, but we don't assume we have these unbelievable trading results going forward. And hopefully, we'll do better than that, but we simply don't know. I also said one point of reserving. Since it's probabilistic. You can actually change nothing in your assumptions but the probabilities of potential outcomes, and put up more reserves.




OperatorWe have no further question at this time.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you.Operator[Operator signoff]

Prepared Remarks:
OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, Please go ahead.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone.I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $4.7 billion, EPS of $1.38 and record revenue of $33.8 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 9%. Included in these results are a number of significant items. First, a credit reserve builds of $8.9 billion and then approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book and $500 million of gains in credit adjustments and other, both of which represent reversals of some of the losses we took in the first quarter.As we continue to navigate this challenging and uncertain environment, this quarter's performance once again demonstrates the benefits of the diversification and scale of our platform. So I'll just touch on a few highlights here.




CIB reported its highest quarterly revenue on record, with IB fees up 54% and markets revenue up 79% year-on-year, each representing record performances with strength across the board. We saw record consumer deposit growth of 20%, up over $130 billion year-on-year, and firmwide average deposits were $1.9 trillion, up 25% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter.Average loans were up 4% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely reflecting the COVID related loan growth that we saw in March. However, on an end-of-period basis, loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter due to revolver paydowns as well as lower balances in card and home lending, partially offset by the impact of $28 billion of PPP loans.And lastly, we increased our CET1 ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter after building approximately $9 billion of reserves and paying nearly $3 billion of common dividends.As you'll recall, we started the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in March. On the following pages, I'll give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at last quarter and share what we're seeing today. So with that, let's turn to page 2.




Starting with wholesale on the top of the page. We saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the quarter as clients sought to pay down the majority of the revolver drawns from March and continued to shore up liquidity while market conditions were receptive supported by extraordinary central bank interventions. The surge in investment grade debt issuance seen in March continued throughout the second quarter, and as high-yield markets reopened, US issuance volumes increased by 19% [Phonetic] compared to the first quarter. In ECM, as markets rebounded to pre COVID levels, May and June together were our two busiest months for equity issuance ever, driven by converts and follow-ons.Moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left. Debit and credit sales volumes, while overall still down, has consistently trended upward since the trough in the second week of April to down just 4% year-on-year in the last two weeks of June. T&E and restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully, though we had seen some improvement, especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend. And most significant improvement we saw was in retail, with a strong recovery in card present volume in the second half of the quarter and consistently strong growth in card-not-present volume throughout the quarter. More recently, we've seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out, notably, in those states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases. We continue to see larger year-on-year declines in states that remain partially closed, particularly those in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions.In terms of consumers' demand for credit, we observe similar recovery trends. In auto, April saw the lowest level of loan and lease originations since the financial crisis. But activity rebounded sharply in May and June, and in fact June ended up the best month for auto originations in our history. And in home lending, retail purchase applications after reaching a low in April recovered to well above pre COVID levels in June due to a strong and broad market recovery.Continuing on the topic of consumer behavior, let's turn to page 3 for an update on what we're seeing around our customer assistance programs. Relative to the peak levels we observed at the beginning of April, we've seen a significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter. To date, we have provided customer assistance for nearly 1.7 million accounts, representing $79 billion of balances across both our owned and serviced portfolios, and of those accounts, a large percentage having made at least one payment while in the forbearance period, just over 50% in both cards and home lending.




In terms of early reenrollment trends, in card, only a small portion of our customers have completed both the initial 90-day deferral period and reached a payment date, but the majority of those customers resumed payments with less than 20% of accounts requesting additional assistance. And then in home lending, of those whose forbearance period expired in June, most have either been extended at the customer's request or auto enrolled into new three month forbearances with approximately 40% of the extensions still current. And so, while we're following the data closely, it's still too early to draw any conclusions.Now moving on to page 4 for some more detail about our second quarter results. We recorded revenue of $33.8 billion, which was up $4.3 billion or 15% year-on-year. While net interest income was down approximately $600 million or 4% on lower rates, mostly offset by higher market NII and balance sheet growth, noninterest revenue was up $4.9 billion or 33%, predominantly driven by CIB markets and IB fees. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $700 million or 4% year-on-year on revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses. This quarter, credit costs were $10.5 billion, including net reserve builds of $8.9 billion and net charge-offs of $1.6 billion.Let's turn to page 5 for more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $8.9 billion for the quarter consists of $4.6 billion in wholesale and $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly card. The reserve increase in the first quarter was predicated on an acute but short-lived downturn, with a solid recovery in the second half of the year. And while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent weeks, there does continue to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery.At the bottom of the page, you can see our updated base case. But remember, this is just one of five scenarios we used to derive our allowance for credit losses. Our build is based on the weighted outcome of these scenarios and assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower GDP recovery and an unemployment rate that remains in the double digits through the first half of 2021. In addition to the obvious impact on consumer, this protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad-based impact across wholesale sectors than we assumed in the first quarter.




Given the increased uncertainty of the macro economic outlook, how customer payment behavior will play out and the future of government stimulus and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both consumer and wholesale clients, we put more meaningful weight on the downside scenario this quarter, and so therefore we're prepared and have reserves for something worse than the base case. And given CECL covers the life of loans, if our assumptions are realized, we wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward.Now moving to balance sheet and capital on page 6. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, which is over 100 basis points above our new SCB based minimum of 11.3%. And just to touch on SLR, while our reported ratio is 6.8%, it's worth noting that we're not going to rely on temporary relief and so without that our ratio is 5.7%. As we said in late June, unless things change meaningfully, the Board intends to maintain the $0.90 dividend in the third quarter. Given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes on why we're comfortable saying that, including the value of our strong and steady earnings stream as well as how we're managing our capital through this crisis.So with that, let's go to page 7. It's an obvious point, but it's worth a reminder that since 2018 our average quarterly PPNR of over $13 billion has been generating over 60 basis points of new CET1 capacity per quarter even after having made meaningful investments in our businesses. This powerful earnings stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our customers and clients when they need us most, and it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly replenish capital in times of stress. While over the last two and a half years we've paid out approximately 100% with cumulative earnings, distributing nearly $75 billion of excess capital, we're now building a significant amount of capital since we suspended our share repurchases. And we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe scenarios, which you can see on page 8.Standing here today, we have $34 billion of reserves and $191 billion of CET1 capital, of which $16 billion is excess over and above our regulatory buffers. Our 3.3% SCB translates to $51 billion of capital that is available to pre-fund stress at any time. And on top of that, our 3.5% GSIB surcharge translates to another $54 billion, all that so our $69 billion regulatory minimum is never touched.




And as you know, we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios and one of them is the extremely adverse scenario that Jamie discussed in the shareholder letter earlier this year. We've updated this analysis and it now assumes an even deeper contraction of GDP, down nearly 14% at the end of 2020 versus 4Q '19 and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly 22%. Even under this scenario, we estimate that we would end the year with a CET1 ratio above 10% and we would be down by that or regulatory minimum would be 10.5%. While we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers, this scenario would require us to do so, but notably only to a small extent.It's also worth noting that based on the limited information provided from the Fed about their U and W scenarios, we believe that our extremely adverse scenario simulates an even worse path for the economy over the next 12 months. And even if we get this wrong and our losses are twice as high, we still wouldn't use the entire SCB.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOkay. Yeah. So, this is Jamie.




I'd just like to amplify a couple of these points. So, we're showing this example. Obviously, it's predicated on a lot of assumptions, which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just simply to show that we can bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an extreme average, which roughly may equate to U or W of the Fed. And we're going do a lot more analysis than that because obviously we need to be prepared for that.We dip into advanced CET1 because we're taking no actions. So, I've already told you that advanced capital is very pro-cyclical, so as things get downgraded your RWA goes way up. Your capital base doesn't change that much but the RWA goes way up, and there'd be lots of actions we would take that we can avoid that from taking place whatsoever. The other thing I want to point out is this extreme average probably can't happen in one quarter. It will happen several quarters. We don't really know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like that. So even if the economy starts to head there, it will take us a couple of quarters before you make the determination that that has a 100% possibility.Remember, this is saying, we now believe it's 100%. But of course, things can be worse, by the way, but we're just trying to show you that how much capital the Company does have. And the dividend -- now, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself; I am not, OK? Today, we have all that PPNR, all that earnings, all the things, so we can be foolish to get the future of extreme adverse and cut your dividend, because we can easily go through very, very tough times and never cut the dividend. However, if you enter something like extreme adverse, all of a sudden you have new scenarios which are even worse. You don't know. So, at one point, the Board will consider cutting the dividend because things can get even worse than extreme adverse and we want to be able to handle anything out there.The primary concern of the Company is to serve our clients, serve our community through thick or thin and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So, there is no intent to do it. But if things get really bad, and we use the word materially and significantly, and that's something to look at. The other thing by the way is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses and not the CCAR type of stuff. You all is doing estimates to show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not lose that kind of money on credit, OK? And on the next page, Jen's going to explain some stuff on the -- a few slight additional comments.




I also want you to -- she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think that temporary is a funny thing to go into a crisis, and you could use it for a while, but it disappears on March 1 or February 1. So my view is we shouldn't rely on anything like that.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd all this add, Jamie, to the point on advanced RWA.If you look on the slide, then you can see we traveled from 13.1% to 10.4%. About half of that is just the RWA increasing and the other half just the [Indecipherable].




So anyway, as Jamie said, moving on to page 9. All of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework that still has opportunities for recalibration. So, while we've talked about this for years, it has perhaps never been more important. I'll start with CCAR, and Jamie just made this point, but it is not predictive of what we actually think would happen. And the best example of this might be the global market shock. It is a significant portion of the SCB and we've obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of 2020.So, we continue to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework, including the points we've previously made about GSIB. These changes would foster a higher pace of economic growth over time without compromising financial stability.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.




So, again, I just want to emphasize a couple of things here. So look, the point of CCAR was that banks couldn't handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of what your results might be. So all the CCAR tests roughly equate to a global financial crisis, and all the CCAR tests always have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing nine quarters. But in the ensuing nine quarters, at the Lehman we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a quarter. We take actions, we're diversified, we've got other streams of earnings.And so we're not against CCAR because that's protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst, but that's not necessarily predictive. The global market shock, which I think really have $25 billion in counterparty losses. Again, just to be instructive of that. In '08 and '09, you had Fannie May go bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt, you had Bear Stearns effectively, you had Lehman Brothers effectively, you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in Europe, tons of counterparty failures, and our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of $4 billion, not $25 billion.And of course, it's quickly made back because as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading, spreads gap out and then also -- and you're making more money trading because -- and have recoveries in position. So the stress capital buffer of 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose, and so -- and I hope, over time we can drive that down by taking real actions to a number closer to 2.5%.GSIB itself, I pointed out before -- I'm not against the concept of big banks and more capital and all, but GSIB is -- it's not the same as CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strength, your earnings, your PPNR and things like that. GSIB does not. It's just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It doesn't include diversification, it doesn't include margin, it doesn't include actions, it doesn't include -- and just really not representative at all of, I would say, risk of a company or something like that.




And so, we have enough capital to fund a lot of stuff, which is -- we've always run the Company that way. We've always run the Company so that we can handle adverse times because in my short life time, I've seen crises over and over and over and over. We're not predicting them. We're just prepared for them.So, I'll stop there.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerOkay. Thank you.




All right. So let's go on to the businesses. So I'll start on page 10 with Consumer and Community Banking.So CCB reported a net loss of $176 million including reserve builds of $4.6 billion. Revenue of $12.2 billion was down 9% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, lower transaction activity and customer relief, partially offset by strong deposit growth and home lending margin expansion. The deposit margin was down 108 basis points year-on-year on a sharp decline in rates. But deposit growth was a record 20% year-on-year, up over $130 billion. We would estimate that approximately 50% of that growth is COVID related due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses, lower consumer spending and tax payment delays.Mobile users were up 10% year-on-year. And since the start of the pandemic, we've seen increased levels of digital engagement. For example, quick deposit enrollment is up 2 times pre-COVID levels.As I noted earlier, for consumer lending, the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that continued to evolve. Auto loan and lease originations were down 9% year-on-year due to the exit of the Mazda partnership. Excluding this impact, auto originations were up mid single digits. And while the home lending market was favorable, home lending total originations were down 1% year-over-year, driven by declines in correspondent volume substantially offset by an increase in retail volume.




Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year, driven by home lending down 14% due to prior loan sales and card down 7% on lower spend, offset by business banking up 59% due to PPP originations.Expenses of $6.6 billion were down 3% driven by lower travel related benefits, structural and marketing expenses. And lastly, credit costs included the $4.6 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion driven by card.Now turning to the Corporate and Investment Bank on page 11. CIB reported net income of $5.5 billion and an ROE of 27% on revenue of $16.4 billion.Investment banking revenue of $3.4 billion was up 91% year-on-year, largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets as well as the gains on our bridge book which were primarily a function of improved market conditions. IB fees for the quarter were an all-time record, up 54% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank and grew our market share to 9.8% for the first half of the year.




In advisory, we were up 15% driven by the closing of a few notable transactions. Debt underwriting fees were up 55%. We maintained our number one rank in overall wallet and we're the leaders in lead-left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 93% and we grew share by approximately 200 basis points relative to the first quarter.With regards to outlook, we expect third quarter IB fees to be down both sequentially and year-on-year due to the usual seasonal declines and lower M&A announcements year-to-date. And if the economy begins to stabilize, we expect capital markets to revert to normal levels. However, any sustained period of instability could result in additional demand for liquidity and therefore increased capital markets activity.Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79% year-on-year, an all-time record, driven by strong performance throughout the quarter, and it was only later in June that activity began to revert to more normal levels. We saw strength across products and regions from both flow trading and large episodic transactions. While strong buying activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme, our market-making activity this quarter benefited from improved market liquidity, and we were able to better monetize flows.Fixed income was up 99% year-on-year or 120% adjusted for the gain from the IPO of Tradeweb last year, driven by very active primary and secondary markets across products, particularly in macro. Equities was up 38%, largely driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash.




Looking forward, we expect the slowdown that we started to see toward the end of June to continue. In addition, the second half of last year was very strong, making any year-on-year comparison difficult. But obviously the environment makes forecasting markets' performance even more challenging than usual.Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by a reporting reclassification in merchant services. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year as continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volume and higher average deposit balances. Credit adjustments and other was a gain of $510 million as I mentioned upfront, driven by the tightening of funding spreads on derivatives, and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 19% compared to the prior year due to revenue related expenses. Finally, credit costs of $2 billion reflect the net reserve builds I referred to earlier.Now moving on to Commercial Banking on page 12. Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $691 million which included reserve builds of approximately $2.4 billion. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher deposits and loans and equity investment gain and higher investment banking revenue, largely offset by lower deposit NII. Record gross investment banking revenues of $851 million were up 44% year-on-year due to increased bond and equity underwriting activity.Expenses of $899 million were down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $237 billion were up 41% year-on-year as the increase in balances from March have largely remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this environment.




End of period loans were up 7% year-on-year, but down 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 7% quarter-on-quarter as revolver utilization, while still elevated, has declined significantly from the all-time highs in March. However, this was partially offset by the impact of PPP loans. CRE loans were flat, with generally lower originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. Credit costs of $2.4 billion included the reserve builds mentioned earlier and $79 million of net charge-offs, roughly half of which were in oil and gas.Now on to Asset and Wealth Management on page 13. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $658 million with pre-tax margin and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was up 1% year-on-year as growth in average deposit and loan balances along with higher brokerage activity were largely offset by deposit margin compression.Expenses of $2.5 billion were down 3% year-on-year, with lower structural as well as volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued investments in advisors. Credit costs were $223 million, driven by the reserve builds that I mentioned earlier.For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $29 billion positive across all channels and all regions, led by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity inflows of $95 billion, making us the number one institutional money manager globally.




AUM of $2.5 trillion and overall client assets of $3.4 trillion, up 15% and 12% year-on-year respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products.And finally, deposits were up 20% year-on-year on growth in interest-bearing products and loans were up 12%, with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.Now on to Corporate on page 14. Corporate reported a net loss of $568 million. Revenue was a loss of $754 million, down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities. And expenses of $147 million were down $85 million year-on-year.Now let's turn to page 15 for the outlook. You'll see here that despite the uncertain environment, our latest full year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance. Based on the latest insights, we expect net interest income to be approximately $56 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65 billion, which is slightly higher than expected previously, reflecting the outperformance in the second quarter and will ultimately be an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year.




So, to wrap up, against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment, our second quarter performance highlighted the benefits of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our Company. While the range of outcomes is broader than ever before, our priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on supporting our employees, customers, clients and communities around the globe and on being good stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders.I'd like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the front lines of this crisis and our people here at JPMorgan Chase who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and dedication through these times.And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.Questions and Answers:Operator




[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGood morning, Jen and Jamie. Jen, I was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your commercial exposures to heavily COVID-impacted sectors across CRE and C&I, so thinking oil and gas, travel, retail, just to help us understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve building was directed toward this quarter.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So I'll start by saying the most impacted sectors like the ones that you mentioned represents about a third of our overall exposures. More than half of that is investment grade and two-thirds of the non-investment grade is securities.And in terms of the second quarter downgrades, well, first I'd say, in the first quarter while we were really looking at a deep but short-lived downturn, we were really very much focused on the most impacted sectors. And now that we're looking at a more protracted downturn, we're reserved for a much more broad-based impact across sectors. So just to put that in context, the second quarter reserve build, about 40% of that is in the most impacted sectors versus two-thirds of the builds in the first quarter was the most impacted sectors. And then, in terms of the downgrades that we saw in the second quarter, less than a third of those were in the most impacted sectors.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystAnd for your definition of most impacted sectors, what would you be including in that?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerConsumer and retail, oil and gas, real estate, retail and lodging and subsectors as you think about real estate.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystOkay. And just a quick follow-up question. You maintain the NII outlook for the year despite a pretty big drop in net interest margin. Could you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for NII and maybe how trading NII might play into the thinking?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, it's a great question and you're spot-on, which is Markets helps NII. So the outperformance in Markets helps NII but can be a headwind on NIM, just given that the NIM is below the average. So yes, it was -- maintaining that outlook did have something to do with the outperformance in Markets, you're right.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning. Thanks. Jennifer, just to kick off on the question, on page 3, you went through a lot of detail around the forbearance that you've been given and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during the deferral period. Could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that you've outlined in your base case? What are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I won't go into specific details, but I'll just say a couple of things, which is, it is still too early to really read a whole lot into what we're seeing. The visibility here remains low, I would say, given the amount of support that is out there. But you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk given that they are in forbearance program. So we did account for that as we thought about our reserves.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOkay. Because I'm thinking, all right, you've got the inverse of the right-hand column could be construed as what should be expected to become delinquencies over time. And I'm wondering, as a follow-up question, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that if your assumptions are realized, that you could be basically close to fully reserved for the cycle.Maybe you could give us a sense as to which assumptions you are talking about because I know you're expecting an outcome that's worse than your base case. I was just a little confused about what I should assume your base case is and what assumptions you're pointing to that, if realized, you're done on the reserving.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So, first of all, there are a lot of assumptions, given, as I said, the visibility is still quite low. So assumptions around the economic outlook, and I'll come back to that, assumptions around consumer payment behavior and then assumptions around stimulus.So going back to the economic outlook. We have five different scenarios. We did lean in more heavily to the downside scenarios relative then to what we would have otherwise done. Even the Fed has put equal weight on downside scenarios and their base case. So we certainly thought having a conservative bias there was the prudent thing to do. And so, as you look at that slide 5, that is just the base case. So you can see there exiting this year just under 11%. When you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the five scenarios, we end up with double-digit unemployment through the first half of 2021 versus what you see on page 5 there is just the base case, which shows some improvement relative to the fourth quarter getting down to just under 8% by the end of 2021.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerBetsy, I'll just clarify. The base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli or JPMorgan or Fed estimates, for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are always assumptions about the stimulus and PPP and all these other things. So that is the base case, and we're reserved more than that. So therefore if the base case happens, we may be a reserve. I hope the base case happens.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystMe too.OperatorOur next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport.




James Mitchell -- Seaport Global -- AnalystHey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the consumer and delinquencies. Obviously, you had an impact from deferral programs and delinquencies actually -- 30 day delinquencies were actually down. Can you talk to what you're seeing in the non-deferral programs? It doesn't seem like we're seeing much stress at all, even in early stage delinquencies. What would you attribute that to? What are you seeing in your non-deferral programs?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerI mean, simply, I would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus. And so, as I said, the visibility on what we're dealing with is very, very low, because we're not seeing right now what you would typically expect to see given the recession and so the way we have to think about reserving is it's all about the outlook because we're not actually seeing it today. And so, Jamie has said this many times. May and June will prove to be the easy bumps in terms of its recovery and now we're really hitting the moment of truth I think in the months ahead.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And just to amplify it. In a normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charge-offs go up, home prices go down. None of that's true here. Incomes go down, savings go down. Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So you will see the effect of this recession -- it's not going to see right away because of all the stimulus and the fact 60% or 70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working. So it's just very peculiar times, Jim.James Mitchell -- Seaport Global -- AnalystYeah. No, it's fair. Maybe a follow-up on DFAST. Jamie, you made comments about the market shock. We kind of went through a market shock and everyone's trading held up quite well. Do you see that changing the Fed's view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book? Or is it -- or you don't think that's too optimistic?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not -- what they're looking at is, they're making sure a bank can withstand the bad -- as if they were the -- all the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for things have been good. So I'm not against that concept. I just want to say, if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong, what happens to your trading for something like that. And they do the same assumptions like outflows. The outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis. But they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that.OperatorOur next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.




Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystGreat. Thanks. A quick question on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously there was tremendous balance sheet growth as liquidity built up in the quarter, but how are we thinking about on a go-forward basis? Is that expected to roll off over the next couple of quarters? Is that kind of persistent and is expected to stick around or you're just going to operate with a much larger balance sheet in near term?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I'll start with deposits. I mean, in the first quarter it was very much a wholesale story, and we said we expected to normalize and we have seen that. We started to see that. So, looking ahead on wholesale, I think there are puts and takes. We'll continue to see revolvers pay down, security services will likely continue to normalize. I think tailwinds for deposits, Fed balance sheet expansion will be slower, but we will continue and we do think we'll continue to see organic growth. On the consumer side, probably down from here on tax payments as well as the pickup in consumer spending. But in both cases, I think we'll continue to see very, very strong year-on-year growth both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this year.




And then in terms of balance sheet management, I mean, we manage the balance sheet across multiple dimensions: NII, liquidity, capital and interest rate risk. And so we have had $400 billion of deposit growth since the end of last year. And when you consider, as you note, that some of that growth is likely to be transitory and deployment opportunities have been diminished given the rate environment, we have held a decent amount of that in cash. However, we did add about $88 billion in securities here in the second quarter. And on the deposit side, we've been very disciplined on pay rates.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystSo, if those deposits have grown, we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into securities. Are you looking to fund loans on those?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer




Yes. As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it's going to end up in deposits, and for the most part, lot of deposits will end up in securities because the loan growth usually during a recession doesn't go up that much.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I mean, we should see -- as consumer spending recovers, we should see some growth in card, which will help but we'll have PPP starting to pay down, and as Jamie said, loan growth, but -- likely slower.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer




I should point out that -- look at the big numbers. We have over $1 trillion between cash held at the Central Bank, which is close to $400 billion, $500 billion, Treasuries which is close to $700 billion and other very liquid assets, mostly good securities. That's $1 trillion. When people look at the safety and soundness of an institution like this, that is a tremendous sum of money. Some of it's required; we are required to hold all that liquidity, but some of it's just because we're investing considerably.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystThanks.Operator




Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst -- AnalystGood morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some charge-offs. Obviously, there is a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance, but what are your assumptions in terms of when charge-offs start going up, maybe where they peak and how long will they stay at that level?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




It's really difficult to know. I mean, first we have to start seeing delinquencies. And so, later this year, but next year will be much heavier on charge-offs as you think about realizing the assumptions that we've made in the reserves. It's very -- it's difficult to know. The good thing in CECL is life of loans, so we feel well covered for the scenarios that we're looking at.Matthew O'Connor -- Analyst -- AnalystAnd then remind us -- you are seeing some creep in the nonperforming assets. Obviously, it's at low levels, but they are starting to go up. And remind us why that's not starting to feed into net charge-offs or is this just a timing issue and will in the next quarter or two.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Yeah. When we look at the non-accrual increase in wholesale, half of that is one client. So it's really -- I wouldn't draw any conclusions from that. And as you say, it's creeping up off a very low level. So again, we still aren't seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




Hi. Just more on the reserve question. So, if the Fed base case is achieved, then you are over-reserved. If your base case assumptions which are...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe hope. We hope [Speech Overlap]Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




Okay. And if your base case assumptions, which are more conservative, are realized, then, OK, you're done with the reserve building, and if it's worse, then you have to add more reserves. But since the end of the quarter, we're seeing an increase in COVID cases in Florida and Texas and California and elsewhere. And isn't there a link between an increase in COVID cases with deaths, with economic activity? Or how do you think about that?And I'm staring at slide 2 and I can't get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales volume, and it seems like it's flattening off here in June. So just, since the end of the quarter, if you were to kind of mark-to-market your thinking as of this second with what's happening, do you feel better, worse or the same versus the end of the quarter as it relates to your assumptions?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo, guidance-wise, we feel exactly the same way that we did at the end of the quarter. That's sort of mark to market. And Mike, we are very clear. We cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We are also very clear that -- I know at least think, you're going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June. And you have to be prepared.




So you're going to have a lot of ins and outs. You got people who get scared about COVID. Again, talking about the economy, small businesses, big companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So it just could be murky. Which is why, if you look at the base case, adverse case and extreme adverse case, they are all possible, and we're just guessing at the probabilities of those things. That's all we're doing.We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. This, the word unprecedented is rarely used properly, this time, is being used properly. It's unprecedented what's going on around the world, and I would say COVID itself is a main attribute. So the Fed's W case, they made it very clear their W case is that COVID comes back in a big way in the fall and you have to shut down the economy again. And obviously, we got to be prepared too. We don't know the probably of that. We simply don't know, and I think, by the way, we're waiting time, guessing.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then I would just add, Mike, to clarify that, we are reserved for something worse than the base case, and for all the reasons you said. They informed our decision to rein in a bit more on the downside scenarios. And so while there is a bit of a, we hope, pretty conservative bias here, this does represent our best estimate based upon everything we know which does include the sort of slowdown that you referenced in terms of more recent activity.




Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAll right. And my follow-up would be, kind of in the flip side, during this very difficult time, you've grown deposits over the past year equal to the fifth largest bank. I mean, the deposit growth is kind of off the charts here. So, you said half of that is due to COVID. But is the other half due to share gains? So I guess there's several questions in that. But how much of that is related to digital banking and how much of that do you expect to go away once this crisis has passed?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I talked a little bit about kind of how we're thinking about deposits looking forward. And also, I just clarify, Mike, when we said 50% COVID related, that was on the consumer side. And so that -- we do think some of that will leave with tax payments and consumer spending coming back. And then, in terms of how much of it are the share gains, it's difficult to know at this point. Historically, we have performed well in lower rate environment. And I think you're right. I think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch footprint and our people and all the things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this.




OperatorOur next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning. The first question is for Jamie. A lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are encouraged by the fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions which you've proven today but are hesitant about bank stocks given the overhang of the DFAST resubmissions in the fourth quarter and what that could imply for the dividend. And I guess -- I just, I know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering, under the scenario that you see playing out and relative to that 60 basis points of CET1 generation for quarter, what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of that extreme adverse case.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThey're completely sustainable. And if you -- if we enter the extreme adverse case, the Board should and will consider reducing it. And like I pointed out, the extreme adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend. The reason they would consider reducing it is because once you enter like 14% or 15% unemployment, you don't know the future. So now you're going to have to -- another extreme adverse case, which is going to be 20% unemployment. And therefore, you will protect yourself from that and cutting your dividend is cheap equity.And so the goal is to sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers, it's completely minuscule relative -- quarter by quarter. So this decision could be made as you enter these things. And we're all hoping the base case happens.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




And just as a quick follow-up. We also got this question from investors. In the extreme adverse case, is there a preference toward cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension or is there a difference between the two?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThere is no difference between the two. You cut your dividend, you're going to hopefully put it back when the time comes. And so you know, the temporary suspension just sounds peculiar to suspension. And I've done that twice in my life. It's a prudent thing to do if you might need that capital going forward because things are going to get that terrible or something like that.Maybe the other thing, you can ask the another question, if the base case happens, we're going to end up with far too much capital generation and we'll start buying back stock again, which I hope we can do before it goes way up. So we don't expect that this year, but I wouldn't completely rule it out in the fourth quarter.




OperatorAnd our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Glenn.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHello there. A question for you. So we had this big market rebound in the overall markets and that's led to a lot of revenue. But given this outlook and the uncertain path that we've been talking through this whole time, I'm curious on ways you think about potentially derisking on balance sheet. Now, some of it is just a huge liquidity buildup is a de-risked balance sheet. I get that. But are there proactive things you can do to reduce the high leverage RWA in a more stressed environment? Have you been selling into this recovery is I guess my question.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerDimon?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell, go ahead.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, I'll just -- I guess there's two components to it, which is the investment securities portfolio and then proactive things we do on RWA, if that answers your question, Glenn. I'll start with investment securities. We are being cautious and we have opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure there over the second quarter. And then on RWA, we are -- because we're preparing for a range of outcomes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about if we needed to what could we do. But it is sort of a last resort because we certainly don't want to have any impact on clients and customers. And so we're ready. We're looking at it, but we haven't done anything I would say proactively at this point. We're very much focused on helping clients and customers get through this crisis.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd so let me answer as well. On the consumer side, we, like other banks, have seen -- are kind of prudent tightening up of how you do credit. It's already happened. And obviously you could do some more. But Jen, you had some great numbers about how good credit is. Like I think give those FICO's numbers you gave me the other day, mostly how much better home lending...Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerOh, that was -- on the LTV -- the weighted average LTV.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, LTV, yeah.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerI mean, it's really extraordinary. And I was in mortgage. So I should have remembered but I did have to ask. In 2010, our weighted average LTV on the portfolio in home lending was 90% and it's now 56%.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRight. And you can assume it's better in credit cards, better in auto. We have less subprime. That's the consumer side. On the lending, on the business side, we've always been prudent, we're always very tight and careful and stuff like that. Usually what happens with downturns like this, you get all more serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital. So a lot of these companies have been raising a lot of capital.On the investment side, and this is kind of a peculiarity of accounting, again, we can actually make it more conservative by putting securities into held to maturity, which we've done very little [Indecipherable] I don't personally understand why that reduces risk, but it does reduce SCB and maybe we'll do that over time. But the security portfolio is pretty prudent. They are -- and in trading, it's every day. And so trading is -- just think of trade as that Daniel and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day managing those risk and those exposure and you could assume that they're managing it very, very well and tightly today. And we certainly are not punching through fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious and serve our clients. And so, yeah, you are more conservative. And reducing RWA, yes, we can, if we wanted to, we can start doing that by all these various things.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




Thanks. One quickly on the consumer side. I'm curious if you've had -- we're now four months into the bulk of the lockdown in the United States and some of your branches have been either closed or drive-up only. And we're watching your deposits grow like a weed. So I'm curious if you've learned any lessons that might change your thoughts on the branch network, on your organic growth efforts, as we go forward and come out of this some day.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So, first of all, the deposit number. Deposits went up because of PPP; deposits went up because of the payroll checks that people got; deposits went up -- the revolvers were taken down by $50 billion or something like that. So almost all that ended up in deposits. And of course, a lot of that's already reversed and stuff like that. So you got to look at both sides of that. And -- but you were going to say something, Jen?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




I was just going to add on. I mean, there's -- of course, we're learning a lot. I mean, I mentioned the great deposit enrollment. But we haven't learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around branch expansion. In fact, we just opened our 100th branch in market expansion, so are really excited about that. We think will open probably another 75 this year. So we'll be nearly halfway to the 400 branches that we've talked about in market expansion. And so, we'll see.We do have -- still have about 1,000 branches that are closed. And it's possible that we learn something that helps us think about accelerating de-densification or consolidation, but it will be at the margin, then we're not going to make any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we have the benefit over time of watching our customer behavior. So they can really be the ones that inform our strategy.OperatorOur next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- AnalystYes. Good morning. Two questions. One, on page 6, you give the SLR ratio as adjusted for the temporary relief programs on the capital. I wonder if you had a similar ratio for CET1. And part of that question would also be, which would be the more confining ratio starting next March?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThere is no temporary relief in CET1.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, CET1, the only -- and I'll not even try to call it relief. There is a phase-in on CECL. But it's over many years. And so I don't necessarily think about that as temporary like SLR. SLR, at this point, it is temporary. It is due to expire in the first quarter of next year, which is why we're very focused on managing that without the exclusions.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd they're both -- we manage them both. I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage -- it's like 20 different capital and liquidity ratios.




Charles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- AnalystAnd Jamie, FSOC is meeting today behind closed doors. If I understand, there are two topics. One has to do with mortgage -- secondary mortgage market liquidity and the other with the COVID stress test overlay. Do you have any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI don't. The COVID -- but we obviously have some insights. The COVID -- obviously, we're going to run a new stress test. We're going to run it -- we're going to look at all the Fed cases, U, W and stuff like that because they've laid it out. Perfectly reasonable that people refer that kind of stress tests. I think the mortgage markets is a different issue, OK? And we've been very consistent that mortgages, believe it or not, are more -- far more cost than they should be.




Normally, you've been looking at, if you look at the 10-year rate which is like 60 basis point, the mortgage takes me 1.6% or 1.8% instead of the 3.3%. The cause or the reason for that is because the cost of servicing and origination is so high it's obviously got to be paid through. It's high because an enormous amount of rules and regulation put in place that a lot not create safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basic 80% LTV, verify people's incomes, make sure you're doing the right kind of stuff. And the second one is because there is probably no securitization market.The securitization market is important because it reduces your risk-weighted asset and it puts more incentive for banks to put on their balance sheet and the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So we -- I think they should change that. They should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency mortgages, which are even more -- a lot more expensive than agency mortgages. So once you have a securitization market that people believe in, you have to change Reg A, B a little bit, you're going to have a much better market, the cost of mortgage will come down and they'll particularly come down for people at the low rank. I mean, so this should be phased and it should phase right away.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.




Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- AnalystThanks for taking my questions. I had a broader question and I just want to get your perspectives on public policy and banks and a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress testing. And I know banks are working hard to be part of the solution this time and not part of the problem. But we're also having more open discussions about things like inequality and social justice, which in my opinion are long overdue. But I worry that, fair or not, banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those issues. And I think you see that in things like the mainstream press's depictions of big banks in PPP and stuff like that.Again, I'm just curious if you are concerned at all about populist anti-bank policies gaining traction, however you want to define them, whether it's breaking up the banks, directed lending, rate capture or whatever in a pretty polarized political environment. Or do you think I'm being too alarmist or overly concerned about stuff that is pretty unlikely in our country? So just kind of want to get your perspective just generally on how banks fit into the overall policy and political backdrop.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer




I mean, the thing you guys do every single day when you go to work is just do the right things for the right reasons, serve your customers. And we try to do that. We tried very hard to do take care of our employees, to train people -- we tried very hard to advance black [Indecipherable] in finance, and of course we make mistakes. And so I understand some of the angst out there. But we try to do the best we can. We get involved in policy like this mortgage thing that would be better for Americans. And we understand that people want banks to help America, and we do.The most important thing we could do is be a healthy and vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients. And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So very often we hear that banks should do more. That's not -- irresponsible stuff is responsible. It will be to bad outcomes. And that's kind of we had last time around. So we try to do it right and we try to listen very carefully when there is criticism and sometimes, and often legitimate, that we could have done better or should do better or try to do better in the future.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- AnalystOkay. That's helpful. I guess as broad as that question was, I'm going to ask a very narrow question for Jen on your NII guidance. Does that -- I presume that includes gains on PPP fees for unforgiven loans and have you -- have you quantified that or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude of those figures could be?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo we've been really clear on PPP which is that we don't intend to profit from PPP. That doesn't mean that you won't have some geography issues. So you'll have some revenue and then you have expenses and the profit will be near zero. It is an immaterial amount this quarter given these fees are recognized over the lives of the loans. So it's very little this quarter, both revenue and expenses. And looking out, you'll see -- we'll see more of that probably in the third and fourth quarter. Again, it will still be zero on the bottom line and even the gross numbers won't be meaningful in the grand scheme of things.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you. Good morning, Jen. Can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you talked about? How often do you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify new corporate loans? And second, you touched on earlier in a question about some of the COVID related sectors that are being impacted because of what we're going through. Can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within that COVID group that you mentioned?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo first on the reclassification. We mentioned it was a geography issue in merchant services. It didn't happen.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThere was no reclassification of wholesale loans.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Yeah. And then in terms of the most impacted, I mean, they are the ones that you would expect to see around travel, oil and gas and real estate and retail. So it's the sectors that you would expect to see, although as I said earlier, and it's important to note, that from the downgrades that we experienced in the second quarter, less than a third of them were in the most impacted industry. So, really this is -- we're seeing this as being much more broad based.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. Thank you. And then second. I may have missed this. So I apologize. But in your slide 3, you give us very good detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio. Do you have any numbers on the commercial and corporate portfolios that -- loans that might be in forbearance and is it more commercial real estate or C&I?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThey're just not meaningful numbers. We would have included them had they been. So I'll just go back to what we said, which is, we're just not seeing what you would typically see.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerBut they end up in nonperforming.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThey end up in nonperforming.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYou don't have a category in wholesale or commercial the same way you have a category in consumer.OperatorAnd our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.




Kenneth Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks. Good morning. Just a question on the points in slides you made about capital and long-term opportunities for recalibration. First, I guess, will you have any dialog with the Fed about the 3.3% SCB as some other banks have mentioned? And then secondly, where do you think we stand on the GSIB recalibration to your points about in a systemic risk not -- that shouldn't impact a bank's balance sheet?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe're not going to just go back to the Fed on the 3.3%. But obviously, we're looking at why 3.3%, and we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit. Because we know we have another CCAR coming up in a couple of months. So there is no reason for us to go through extensive amount of work as opposed to fix what's already there.




And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needs a lot of recalibration, but there are things they should have recalibrated for already which is America gold-plated it, which I think was wholly unnecessary. They should have taken cash and treasuries and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. It obviously goes way up when the Fed does things like it's been recently. And they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or growth in the shadow banking system, which they were supposed to do. So I'm just hoping they go about do that at one point, but these things get so wrapped up in political. People politicize very complicated calculations, which I thought kind of peculiar and funny but my view is that they do the numbers they should do them right, and they're just not right anymore.Kenneth Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah. And the second question is, just going back to slide 3, you lay out the percent of accounts on this page. Auto seems to be the biggest. And then in the supplement, on page 13, the balance does seem to imply a bigger percent on deferral. Just can you talk a little bit about the differences there and then why do you think you're seeing more accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes? Thank you.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Okay. I don't actually know the answer to reconciling the supplement to slide 3. So Jason and team can follow up with you on that one.Kenneth Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystMaybe then just a comment about auto on deferrals. What do you think you're seeing in that customer base versus others? And do you think that means anything different for forward credit trends?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer




No.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerNo, yeah.Kenneth Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst




Okay. Thanks very much.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.Christoph Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst




Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. I guess I just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising. Dealogic shows over $2 trillion of debt and equity raised in the quarter. And I guess a two part question around that. One is, as you look at that, was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas and presumably capital that's junior to your bank debt and to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank loans? And then secondly, looking forward, I mean, did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital do so in the second quarter and therefore we're looking at kind of a flat spot going forward or do you see this as kind of -- like there is an ongoing need for a lot of these companies to continue to raise capital?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell, I think, first of all, it's across the board. I mean, you saw as strong companies, weaker companies, high-yield markets opened up, converts -- and put converts and equity in there too, people did a lot of capital raise, and I think it was wise, I think a lot of people said they pre-funded a lot of their capital needs to make sure they can get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that.So I don't think it would be like it was before. So it will definitely come down, but I still think there is opportunity for some people to pre-fund some of that. But it is pre-funding. This is not capital. A lot of those capital was not being raised to go spend. It's been raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you you're prepared for whatever comes next. And you've heard a lot of companies make statements, and you guys go through yourself about we've got two years of cash, we got three years of cash, we got people want to be prepared. I think it's appropriate.




Christoph Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- AnalystOkay. That's it from me. Thank you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerBut just for your models, we don't expect revenues in investment banking -- they will normalize or even come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out. At one point -- we can't predict month by month exactly, and for trading, because no one asked, cut it in half, cut it in half and that'll probably closer to the future than if you say [Indecipherable] double what it normally runs.




OperatorAnd our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerPlease say that's the last question.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And I think the point is straightforward. I just want some clarity really on the major CECL provisioning. And obviously you've made some very big provisions based on much more conservative assumptions, but the nature of CECL provisioning [Indecipherable] could mean that in the third quarter if your assumptions do not change, then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second quarter to a much more normal level. I just wanted to see how you thought about that for the third quarter.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I will start by saying where we are right now. While there is a conservative bias to where we are right now, it is our best estimate of what we're facing. We certainly hope that in the future we look back on it as a conservative moment. But this is our best estimate. And so, if our assumptions are realized -- and again, our reserve reflects something worse in the base case. So if that's realized, then we shouldn't see meaningful reserve builds in the third quarter or if that continues to be [Speech Overlap] third quarter.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystYeah. So I mean, in context, would it be similar to quarters that we've seen in 2019, for example?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, you have reserves for growth but not for the prices.




Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystYeah, exactly, exactly. That's very clear. Thanks for that. And then on the CIB trading environment, and obviously we saw June and we've seen a bit of a July. Would you say that's normalized, so a level consistent with what we've seen with 2019 or are you still seeing some pretty strong trading following through into the third quarter?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI just answered that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know, it's only a couple of weeks into this thing, but we don't assume we have unbelievable trading results going forward. And hopefully we'll do better than that, but we should -- we don't know. I also just want to point to reserving. Since it's probabilistic, you can actually change nothing in your assumptions, but the probability is of potential outcomes to put up more reserves.




OperatorWe have no further questions at this time.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGreat. Thank you.Operator[Operator Closing Remarks]

Prepared Remarks:
OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. As you heard, Jamie is with me on the call, and I know I speak for the entire company when I say we are just thrilled that he's back.




Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the frontlines of this crisis.The presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment, and as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.Starting on Page 1, I'd like to highlight some of the ways we're responding to COVID-19. As a firm, we are focused on being there for our employees, customers, clients, and communities, in what is an unprecedented and uncertain environment. And while we don't know how this will play out, we will be transparent here about our assumptions and what we know today.Our number one priority is to continue to provide our services in an uninterrupted way by also providing a safe work environment for our employees. We're incredibly proud of all that our firm has been able to do over the past few weeks. So, I'll just hit on a few examples here.




We've mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible, including operations and finance teams, portfolio and risk managers, bankers and traders, ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively. Currently, we have about 70% working from home across company, and for many groups, that number is well north of 90%. And for those who still need to go into the office or into a branch, we are taking extra precautions and being extremely mindful of their safety.And we're providing assistance in other ways too. For instance, we're offering free COVID-related medical treatment for U.S. employees and their dependents.On the consumer side, approximately 3/4 of our 5,000 branches have been open, all with heightened safety procedures and many with drive through options, and the vast majority of our over 16,000 ATMs remain accessible. And while our call center capacity has been challenged, we've quickly activated resiliency plans to address customer call seeking assistance and we put in place new digital and self-service solutions in record time. And while wait times have been extended, we're making good progress reducing them.For our customers who are struggling financially during this time, we are providing relief such as a 90-day grace period for mortgage, Auto, and Card payments, as well as waiving or refunding certain fees. We continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment, and in the month of March we extended more than $100 billion of new credit.




In wholesale, clients drew more than $50 billion on their revolvers with us, and we approved over $25 billion of new credit extensions for clients most impacted. And for our small business clients, we're actively supporting the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program.The number you see on the slide are as of April 12. And as of this morning, we have more than 300,000 in some stage of the application process, representing $37 billion in loans, and we funded $9.3 billion to businesses with over 700,000 employees. And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities, as an initial step, we've announced $150 million loan program to get capital to underserved small businesses and non-profits, as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment.Now, turning to Page 2 for highlights on our first quarter financial performance. For the quarter, the firm reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $0.78 and revenue of $29.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 5%.While the underlying business fundamental this quarter performed very well, we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from COVID-19, which I'll discuss in more detail later. And at a high level, these items are a credit reserve build of $6.8 billion, approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives, and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book.




It might be an obvious point that the quarter was really a tale of two cities: January and February, and then March when the crisis started to unfold. And with that, I thought it would be helpful to talk through some key metrics that highlight this dynamic across our businesses.So, let's go to Page 3. Starting with Card sales volume on the top left. In March, we saw a rapid decline in spend, initially in travel and entertainment, which then spread to restaurants and retail, as social distancing protocols were implemented more broadly. While most spend categories were ultimately impacted, we did see an initial boost to supermarkets, wholesale clubs and discount stores as people stocked up on provisions, but even that is now starting to normalize. And we saw similar trends in Merchant Services, as highlighted in the significant decline in brick and mortar spend excluding supermarkets, whereas e-commerce spend has held up well by comparison.In investment banking, in the middle of the page, there was a surge in debt issuance by investment grade clients as the market remained open and clients' desire to shore up liquidity was top of mind. It was the largest quarter ever in terms of investment grade debt issuance led by JPMorgan. And in Markets, volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products, most notably across rates and commodities, which at their peak were more than triple our average January trading volumes.And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us. At the same time, we saw accelerating loan growth, primarily driven by revolver draws.




And finally, flows in AWM were meaningfully different in March compared to January and February. Long-term flows through February was strong, positive across all asset classes. But this was more than offset by outflows in March. On the flip side, we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during March, which more than offset prime money market outflows.Onto Page 4, and some more detail about our first quarter results. Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year on year, and net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII. And noninterest revenue was down 5%, driven by the significant items I already mentioned, which were largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue.Expenses of $16.9 billion were up 3%, driven by higher volume and revenue related expenses, continued investments and higher legal expense, all of which were largely offset by structural expense efficiencies. This quarter, credit costs were $8.3 billion, including a net reserve build of $6.8 billion, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 and net charge-offs of $1.5 billion in line with prior expectations.Now, turning to Page 5, we have some more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $6.8 billion for the quarter consists of $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly Cards, and $2.4 billion in wholesale, with builds primarily due to impacts of COVID-19 as well as lower oil prices. This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year.




In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing to our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs.And in wholesale, the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by COVID-19, such as in consumer and retail and also in oil and gas. We expect other sectors to be impacted to a lesser extent, if we have a way to prolong downturn. We have also assumed that the stress in oil and gas continues with WTI remaining below $40 through the end of 2021.After we closed the books for the quarter, our economists updated their outlook, which now reflects a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP and unemployment. If that scenario were to hold, we would be building in the second quarter and build could be meaningfully higher, in aggregate, over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter. A primary unknown is the duration of the crisis, which will directly impact losses across our portfolio.With that being said, our consumer portfolio skews more prime than the industry average. And the effectiveness of government support, customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits, while uncertain, undoubtedly will act as mitigant to the losses. And so even though our losses will be material, we will be doing what we can to help our customers recover from this crisis and help our clients stay in business.




Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 6. Our balance sheet, capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong and, importantly, allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of strength. And that, combined with our earnings power, is an extraordinary base to absorb the inevitable losses to come.For the quarter, we distributed $8.8 billion of capital to shareholders, which includes $6 billion in net share repurchases up to March 15th. Since then, we stopped our buybacks, which was both a prudent decision at the time and consistent with what we always say, which is that we would prefer to use our capital to serve our customers and clients. This capital distribution outweighed our earnings for the quarter, and this coupled with significant RWA growth resulted in a decline in our CET1 ratio to 11.5%.On RWA, which you can see on the bottom right of the page, the key drivers of growth were market volatility, which should subside over time, and more importantly, an increase in lending at this critical time for our clients. Going forward, in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients, we are prepared to use our internal buffers, which may mean our CET1 ratio falls below our target range; and if necessary, we can also use regulatory buffers to go below our 10.5% minimum. It's worth noting here, that an environment like this is precisely why we have the buffers in the first place.We currently also have capacity and intend to continue to pay the $0.90 dividend, pending Board approval. And as you can see in the CET1 walk on the bottom left, it is a small claim on our capital base.




And before we move on, just a moment on liquidity. Even with everything we facilitated, our liquidity position remains strong. And looking forward, it's helpful to remember that we have significant liquidity resources beyond HQLA, including the discount window if need be.Now, turning to the businesses, starting with Consumer and Community Banking on Page 7. CCB reported net income of $191 million, including reserve build of $4.5 billion. January, February, showed a continuation of strength across the business, but again March showed a major shift in trends. And across our consumer segments, we saw a drastic deceleration in spend across all forms of payments and a decline in origination volumes, except in the mortgage refi market. And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows in merchant processing activity, early signs of pressure on payment and delinquency rates as well as line utilization, and increased demand for credit.Turning back to the results, revenue of $13.2 billion was down 2% year-on-year. In consumer and business banking, revenue was down 9% driven by deposit margin compression, partially offset by strong deposit growth of 8% that accelerated in the quarter.Deposit margin was down 56 basis points year-on-year and we expect it to decline further, given the current rate environment. Home lending revenue was down 14%, driven by lower net servicing revenue and lower NII, partially offset by higher net production revenue. And in Card and Auto, revenue was up 8%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion. Average Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity.




Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies.And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve build I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion driven by Card and consistent with prior expectations.Now, turning to the Corporate and Investment Bank on Page 8. CIB reported net income of $2 billion, and ROE of 9% on revenue of $9.9 billion. Investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year. But as the market environment shifted, we saw delays in M&A announcements and completions, postponement of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit. At the same time, the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately $380 billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors.By contrast, the high yield market was effectively closed, and high yield spreads widened significantly. As a result, our bridge book commitments were marked down by $820 million. And here, it's worth noting, our bridge book exposure is about 1/4 of what it was entering the 2008 crisis and is a higher quality portfolio.




As a result of this backdrop, IB revenue of $886 million was down 49% year-on-year, largely driven by the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were up 3% year on year, and we maintained our number one rank with 9.1% wallet share.Advisory was down 22%, not only due to a tough compare, but also reflecting delays in regulatory accruals pushing out the closing of certain large deals. We did, however, complete more deals than any other bank this quarter.Equity underwriting was up 25% versus the challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in January and February before the market effectively closed in March. And debt underwriting was up 15%, and an all-time record. We maintained our Number-One rank with 9.5% share of 90 basis points from 2019. Lending revenue was up 36% year-on-year, driven by the impact of spread widening on loan hedges.Looking forward, while a rapid recovery in the economy could produce a corresponding rebound in activity, we could also see significant downside risk to our forward-looking pipeline if the downturn is protracted.




Now, moving to Markets. Here, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 32% year-on-year. It's worth noting that even before the crisis, as we said in Investor Day, Markets performance was strong for the quarter. Then, the growing COVID-19 concerns triggered a major correction of equity markets, significant widening of spreads and a spike in volatility, leading to extraordinary government intervention and a substantial change in monetary policy, followed by a sharp decline in treasury yields. Simultaneously, we also saw a drop in oil prices. This unique combination of events led to further increased client participation and record trading volumes in several products.Fixed income was up 34%, driven by strong client activity, most notably in rates and currencies and emerging markets. Equity markets was up 28% on strength in equity derivatives, driven by increased client activity. In terms of outlook, it goes without saying that it's too early to project this performance going forward. In fact, low rates and low economic activity may even be a headwind. However, we are in a strong position to continue playing a central role in ensuring the orderly functioning of markets and serving our clients' needs.And now on the Wholesale Payments, a new business unit we're reporting this quarter, comprised of treasury services, trade finance and the Merchant Services business, which was previously part of CCB. Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year, driven by reporting reclassification in Merchant Services.As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in Wholesale Payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity. In Security Services, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances.




In Wholesale Payments and Security Services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, maybe relatively short-lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes If the crisis is elongated.Credit Adjustments and Other was a loss of $951 million, which was one of the significant items that I mentioned upfront. Credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by the net reserve build I referred to earlier. And finally, expenses of $5.9 billion were up 5%, driven by higher legal and volume-related expenses and continued investments.Now, moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 9. Commercial Banking reported net income of $147 million, including reserve build of approximately $900 million. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 10% year-on-year with lower deposit NII and lower rates and a $76 million markdown on the bridge book, partially offset by higher deposit balances.Gross Investment Banking revenues were $686 million, down 16% year-on-year compared to a record prior year. While we remain confident in our long-term target, we expect some softness in our pipeline, specifically related to M&A and equity underwriting.




Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed in Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March, with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity.End of period loans were up 14% year-on-year, mainly driven by increases in C&I loans in March. C&I loans were up 26% as revolver utilization increased to 44%, which is an all-time high. CRE loans were up 3%, and here the story remains largely unchanged. Higher origination in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, were partially offset by declines in Real Estate Banking as we remain selective.Credit costs of $1 billion, included the reserve build I mentioned, and $100 million of net charge-offs largely driven by oil and gas.Now, onto Asset and Wealth Management on Page 10. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $664 million with pre-tax margin of 24% and ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees and higher average market levels and net inflows over the past year. And then in addition, we saw record brokerage activity in March related to the recent market volatility. These increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations.




Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses.Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds from the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth. Net long-term outflows were $2 billion and the strength we saw in January and February was more than offset in March. At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry-leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier.AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels. Deposits were up 9% year on year on growth in interest bearing products. And finally, loan balances were up 11% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.Now onto Corporate on Page 11. Corporate reported a net loss of $125 million, revenue was $166 million, a decline of $259 million year-on-year, primarily due to lower net interest income and lower rates, partially offset by higher net gains on investment securities. Expenses of $146 million were down $65 million year-on-year.




And now, let's turn to Page 12 for the outlook. At Investor Day, we showed you a path to 2020 where we expected net interest income to be slightly down from 2019. And obviously, since then, the backdrop has changed significantly. Based on the latest implies and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth and CIB Markets NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year. And to give you an idea for the second quarter, we expect NII to be $13.7 billion.On non-interest revenue, it's always difficult to provide meaningful guidance and even more so, given the current heightened level of uncertainty. But based on our best estimates today, we do expect to see headwinds in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds included a $3.5 billion decrease in non-interest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and as we offset the higher CIB Markets NII, and therefore revenue neutral. We also expect to see pressure on AWM and investment banking fees. And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day.It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and we'll keep you updated on future earnings calls.So, to wrap up, the challenges we are all facing as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented. Although we don't quite know what the past will look like going forward, what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees, clients, customers, and communities, as we always have been; and we have the talent, resources, and operational resiliency to do so.




Our employees have proven that being resilient is not just about maintaining operations, it's also about culture. And that feels stronger than ever with our teams around the world working harder than ever to continue to serve our clients, customers, and communities. We've never been more proud of our people and we simply can't thank them enough.And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.Questions and Answers:OperatorAnd our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.




Erika Najarian -- BofA Securities -- AnalystHi, good morning. And, Jamie, we're glad that you could join us, and that you're well enough to join us. My first question is on the forbearance activity. Jen, if you could give us a sense of, by product, how many of your clients, for example, in Card and Auto, home lending, are in a forbearance state so they started to defer the payment to the percentage of your clients? And, how we should think about the significant government intervention relative to the severely adverse scenarios, I believe, for total losses of 5.9% over nine quarters for the Fed and 4.1% for company run?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, first of all, I'll start with the payment relief forbearance there. I will start by saying that we have already refunded millions of dollars in fees. We have approved payment relief for 100s of thousands of accounts across consumer lending, and we obviously expect that to be meaningfully higher through time.




We pause for closures and Auto repossessions, and importantly, we've made the process easier for our customers through digital and self-service options that we've built in record time. But in terms of what we're seeing, those are the numbers that still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we think we'll ultimately see. In mortgage, just to give you context, outside of customers asking for forbearance, which is just a little over 4% of our service book at this time, the April 1st payment seems BAU. In Card, we're seeing payment rate is down a bit, but still strong, and we've seen a slight uptick in late payments in Auto. But the quality of these portfolios was strong coming in as we've done surgical risk management over the last few years and that has made these portfolios more resilient.And then in terms of how we think about the significant government intervention; I mean, I think the ultimate effectiveness of these programs, which are extraordinary in terms of the direct payments or the enhanced unemployment insurance, the ultimate effectiveness is I think the biggest unknown. The key obviously is being able to bridge people back to employment. And so, we had assumed, as best we could, for our first quarter results, the impact of those programs, as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that we'll be providing for our customers. But that is for sure an unknown and we certainly expect to learn a lot more about that in the second quarter.Erika Najarian -- BofA Securities -- AnalystThank you. My second question, you mentioned that you're prepared to go below 10.5% CET1 to help your clients. Going below 10.5% is also when the automatic restriction starts kicking in from the Fed in terms of payout. So if I understand it, it would be a 60% payout restriction on eligible net income. And just wanted to understand your thoughts on balancing servicing your clients and also thinking about your capital levels relative to those automatic restrictions from the regulators.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, as you probably know, Erika, that the Fed made some changes there recently, which as you say, puts us in a 50% bucket as we go below 10.5%. And we have a reasonable amount of room below 10.5% to remain in the 60% bucket. I would say that that was very helpful clarification from the regulators in terms of how we should think about using regulatory buffers, so that was particularly helpful. And right now, we are focused on serving clients and customers and we've looked at a range of scenarios, so we can ensure that we're managing our capital quite carefully.Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his Chairman's letter that we've looked at, assuming large parts of the economy remain in lockdown through the end of this year. And in that scenario, our CET1 drops to about 9.5%. And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios, so we make sure that we're prepared.Operator




Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo & Company -- AnalystHi, and welcome back, Jamie. The question is for you. How do you thread the needle between supporting your customers and the country and doing all those things that you want to do while still protecting the resiliency of the balance sheet and not getting hit with unexpected litigation costs as you mentioned in your CEO letter?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Yes, no, it's a very important question. And I think in times of need, banks have always been the lender of last resort to their customers. And obviously, you've got to be a disciplined capital provider because undisciplined loans are bad. So, you take a calculated risk and we're making additional loans. We're adults, we know that if the economy gets worse, we'll bear additional loss. But we do forecast all of that, so we are -- we know we can handle really really adverse consequences.There will be a point and the last question brought up was where you get below 10% CET1 even though we'll have almost $200 billion capital and $1 trillion liquidity, all these other constraints start to kick in like SLR, G-SIFI, advanced risk-weighted assets that make tighter constraint. And so, and then obviously then you got to look forward. So, we want to do our job. If we can help the country get through this, everybody is better off. If we move a little bit more money in the meantime, so be it. But obviously, we will protect our company, our balance sheet, our growth, and we'll be having close conversation with the regulators about what that is.I also think you have to take in consideration the extraordinary measures the government has taken. That's the income to individual, PPP, and all these Federal Reserve things.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo & Company -- Analyst




So, also in your CEO letter, you talk about the economy coming back online. And I guess with your reserve build, you're assuming, what, 10% unemployment and then the economy improves in the second half of the year. So, what is your base case for how people come back to work that's behind those descriptions? And I know you have a lot of scenarios too, but just a base case.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, I'll let Jen talk about the base case. But I think the back-to-work, we should think it as a binary thing that after the CDC, and we all get instructions from the government, after there's enough capacity in the hospitals, after there's proper amount of testing. Remember, a lot of people are going to work to-date in farms, factories, food production, retail, pharmacies, hospitals. So, this is like no one's going to work and hopefully you can turn it back on where it's very safe. There is plenty of capacity. You're not worried that you can give every American, who does get sick, the best possible medical advice. And the turn on would be regional, by company, all following standards of best health practices. And in some ways, you need to get that done because the bad economy has very adverse consequences way beyond just the economy, and in terms of mental health, domestic abuse, substance abuse, etc. So, a rational plan to get back is a good thing to do, and hopefully it will be tuned around later, but it won't be May. You're talking about June, July, August, something like that. So, I don't know if that answers your whole question.And then, Jen, you give the base case.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, Mike, as we closed the books for the first quarter, just to give a context, we were looking at an economic outlook that had GDP down 25% in the second quarter, unemployment above 10%. It's just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it, but there's a lot more that goes in to our reserving, including management judgment about some -- like, world-class risk management and finance people and also other analytics. And so, that just kind of gives you a frame of reference. But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving and we also thought about the impact, what's our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief programs.Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment 20%. That's obviously materially different. Both scenarios though do include a recovery in the back half of the year. And so, all else equal, and of course, the one thing, probably the only thing we know for sure, Mike, is that all else won't be equal when we close the books for the second quarter. But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter. But again, a lot will depend on the ultimate effect of these extraordinary programs and how effective they can be in bridging people back to employment. And we're going to still have a number of unknowns, I would say, at the end of the second quarter, but we're going to learn a lot through these next few months that will inform our judgment for second quarter reserves.Operator




Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHey, good morning. And, Jamie, nice to have you back. So, I wanted to ask a question on some of the remarks relating to capital. Corals [Phonetic] actually made some comments on Friday alluding to efforts by the Fed to incorporate real life COVID stress in the upcoming CCAR cycle. We haven't gotten much color since then. I'm wondering whether you received any guidance from the Fed on which changes, if any, they plan on contemplating for this year's task? And maybe just bigger picture, how you're thinking about the potential impact that could have on the SCB and potentially raise some of your capital requirements?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, we haven't gotten specific guidance. But it certainly makes sense that the Fed would want to look at a scenario like that. We have been, as you might imagine, staying very close to our regulators through this crisis, so they can have a very good understanding of how we are managing things. And then in terms of the potential impact, we'll learn more about that in June. We've given our best estimate of FCB and the impact it will have on our minimums, and that is absolutely incorporated into our thinking about how we'll manage capital through a range of scenarios here. But we'll learn more from the Fed in June.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer[Speech Overlap] one stress test, which will not be the stress you go through. JPMorgan does 100 a week and we're always looking at potential outcomes, and obviously we're doing our own COVID-related type of stress testing, including extreme, and we'll always be updating them, talking to regulators about it. Because that's what we have to deal with this time, not what I would consider a traditional stress test.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Yes, the range of outcomes probably have never been broader. And so, as Jamie said, we have -- CCAR has been a good place for us to start in terms of one scenario, but we have looked at a number of different scenarios that how this may play out. And obviously, Jamie articulated what we think could be an extreme adverse, and we're prepared for that too. So, I think the most important thing is that we're prepared for a range of outcomes and we'll learn more about SCB in June.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystGot it. And just a follow-up on the securities book. Just given some of the significant declines at the long end of the curve, Jen, I was hoping you could help us think about where reinvestment levels are today just compared with the 2.48% yield on the bridge book? And then just separately, given the large impact of QE-driven deposit growth, how you're deploying some of that excess liquidity in this environment?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So, on the Investment Securities portfolio, managing the balance sheet in this rate environment is obviously a different dynamic. And with lower rates as well as the deposit growth that you mentioned, with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our Investment Securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense. Right now, in terms of balance sheet management, we are completely focused on supporting client activity. Our balance sheet is harder to predict right now but we are prepared for ranging outcomes.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay, thanks very much.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure.OperatorOur next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS Group AG -- Analyst




Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on CECL related question. Jen, you gave us a good amount of color [Technical Issues] economic assumptions that were used to build the reserves and where Bruce Kasman and your economics team is now for the second quarter. But maybe thinking about it a little bit differently in terms of how to attribute the CECL reserve builds, and we're not looking for specific numbers, more just directional. How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that you're seeing in your book that maybe aren't showing up in credit measures but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it, within the next few quarters; how much of it is growth, how much of it is mix? Just if you can talk to that, because I guess what I'm trying to get at is, how much of it is more mechanistic and how much of it is actual tangible signs that you're seeing that of financial stress in your borrower base that could emerge in the reasonably near futures credit losses?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, it's a great question, Saul. So, I would start by saying that we haven't actually seen a stress emerge as of yet. So, I wouldn't necessarily use the term mechanistic, but I would say that what we took in the first quarter is our best estimate of future losses. It's also important to note that we don't reserve for future growth. And so, future growth with all else being equal, the reserve build. So, I wouldn't necessarily think of this as materially different because of CECL. We didn't actually really think about the impact of CECL relative to the incurred model. I mean, the regulators have given their point of view on that given the change in the capital rules, where 25% is assumed to be the difference. But that's their view. And like I said, we didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it and I would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis. And it is life of loan, which of course is different under CECL. And so again, all else equal, you can think Card was larger than it would have been under an incurred model. But we didn't really think about it that way and it's impossible, of course, to know what judgment we would have applied under a different model.Saul Martinez -- UBS Group AG -- Analyst




Okay. No, that's helpful. And, Jen, just on that point of growth, pivoting a little bit; what -- obviously a lot of the pressure in CET1 was because of risk-weighted asset growth and drawdowns on commitments. Where are we in terms of -- where do you think we are in terms of those drawdowns? I think it's like $350 billion still in wholesale commitments -- unfunded commitments. But like, how do we think about that? And, how it -- how much room there is for that to continue to make pressure risk weighted asset evolution?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, like so many other things, it is difficult to predict. I will say that early here in the second quarter, we have seen a pause on revolver draws. But it could very well just be a pause. And so, we are assuming, as we think about our own capital plans, that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter albeit at lower levels than the first quarter. And then of course, the timing in the case of the pay downs will depend upon the ultimate path of the virus and the economic recovery.Operator




Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi. Thanks very much. I appreciate the limited sight we all have and maybe we could, let's assume, hopefully sooner than later, we get past the bulk of the credit impact. On the other side of this, have you thought about lending spreads underwriting criteria and how much turns we need to tighten given what we've learned or a scenario that we didn't capture under its previous underwriting? In other words, does lending spreads widen and do you get paid more for your balance sheet? I'm just curious on how you're thinking about risk management on a go-forward basis?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. And so, there I would say that our approach, we always take a long-term franchise view on things like that. And so, our philosophy has not changed. It is true, however, that the marginal cost of new activity is higher for us right now, and so that's a consideration. But I would say, in terms of risk management, we do what we've always done and what we always do, which is: Manage carefully within our risk appetite. And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis and we'll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'll just add. On the consumer side there's forward-looking view of risk. On the wholesale side, the revolvers were taken down to like $50 billion of our existing spreads. The bilateral stuff has been done, i.e. new credits. They've been done at slightly different spreads and stuff like that are higher. And then trading, obviously, you're actually getting higher spreads and a lot of things you do influence your finance people and do things and stuff like that. And then you will see a tightening of credit in the market. Think of leverage lending, certain underwriting, certain non-bank lenders who are no longer there. So, you will see an eventual tightening and an eventual increase in spreads, but you won't see banks do price gouge, which you've seen in other industries. Banks are very careful to support their clients through times like this.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




Okay. And then one more impossible question, Jen, maybe. Could you help qualify, I know you can't quantify, but exit rate revenues that you kind of alluded to in some of the things like underwriting falling off, so tale of two quarters.The quarter itself, if it weren't for the ginormous credit issue that we're facing would have been like: ""Revenue is down a little bit, expenses up a drop, OK."" But how much of the exit rate revenues are we looking at second quarter, third quarter versus the full first quarter? And that's a hard one.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, Glenn, I'm glad you acknowledged that it's impossible question and a hard one. I think, so there is a reason why we gave directional guidance here in terms of what could be headwinds, but it is just impossible to predict right now, as you point out. So, but I will say -- like, if you think, there is obviously nothing that we can really say with confidence about exit rate in 2021. I will say based upon the latest implies, if you look at NII, you could see growth in 2021 on balance sheet growth there, and then NIR is absolutely going to depend on the path of the virus and the economic recovery and when and how we all get back to work. And then, we've given you expense guidance to think about.And then from a credit perspective, as I said, we could see continued builds over the next several quarters. But the way CECL works in theory, again all else equal, that should be -- could be behind us by the end of the year and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into 2021.




OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you. Good morning. Can you -- I know you gave us the color on the base case and the downturn in the second quarter. What's your outlook on the recovery in the second half of the year? Can you give us any color on what kind of recovery you're expecting in the second half of the year as part of the seasonal reserve build there?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, it is -- I don't have the numbers to hand, Gerard, but they're public. It was -- I suppose you can say it was based on our economist's outlook at the end of March, which did have a recovery. I just don't have the GDP numbers to hand, I think -- and the unemployment. I think what's most important to note, Gerard, is that based upon what we're looking at, you do have a recovery in the back half of the year. But it still leaves you, from a GDP perspective and unemployment, below your launch point on absolute levels of GDP and above your launch point on absolute levels of unemployment.So, it's a recovery. It is our latest outlook. And as I said earlier, it is probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time, but it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesn't get us back to where we started. And importantly, as we've said, that we're prepared for a range of scenarios. So while that may be the case that we based our reserve levels off, it is not the only scenario that we are preparing for.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




Very good. And then just as a follow-up on the bridge book, and I apologize if you've addressed this and I missed it. I know you guys mentioned the losses in the bridge book. Could you split us the size of the book, and then some more color on what triggered the losses in the bridge book?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, there I would just start by, as you know, I said it in the prepared remarks, but it's worth repeating, our bridge book is about 1/4 of the size it was in the financial crisis. So, it's about $13 billion. It's slightly down from where we were at year-end. Importantly, we don't have any imminent closing deadlines and the market is actually performing a little bit better here in the second quarter. So, we'll see where we land at the end of the quarter, but so far --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Just basing, marking the positions to market effectively.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And the good news is --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Ex-fees.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerRight. And with no imminent closing deadlines, it's not necessarily the case that we'll realize those losses. But, as Jamie said, they're mark-to-market at the end of the quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




And I would just also put this in perspective; we're adults, we know that we have a bridge loan book that you're going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money. We're the leader in the leverage lending, we're the leader in high yield, the leader in loans, etc. And we intend to maintain that position, and every now and then you have not a particularly good quarter. So, we're not worried about this very much.And like Jen said, so far if we look at spreads, there's probably a recovery this quarter.OperatorOur next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, Jen. Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that you've seen so far and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, hi, John. So, based upon what we're looking at right now, spend was down. We talked about different categories. But spend in aggregate was down 13% in the month of March year-over-year, and we're seeing trends like that continue here in April. And so, with that, I would say that we would, given what we know today, expect outstandings to trend down from here.




John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystAnd then can you help us think about how you do the accounting for the consumer deferrals? You keep accruing, but do you have some kind of haircut for NII suppression in terms of what might not be collectible, even though technically you're allowed to accrue what you defer?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, you got it, John. So, we do continue to accrue, but it is a lower yield over the life of the loan.




OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystI just wanted to -- I had two questions. One, just thinking about the outlook for the next couple of quarters here, I know you mentioned that your economics team had updated their estimates and maybe you could give us a sense as to the timing of when you clip your reserves versus those estimate changes? And part of the reason I'm asking is because of the reserve ratio move between 4Q19 and 1Q20 for the various segments. When I look at the CIB and the commercial bank, the reserve ratios are down from where they were in 4Q19. So, I'm trying to understand how the next change in the reserving is likely to traject between the various asset classes? Is there -- as you move from an adverse case to severely adverse case, are there different asset classes that potentially have a higher uptick in reserve ratio that we should be expecting here?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, on the wholesale side, specifically, Betsy, the reason you see that dynamic is because of CECL. So, and it's in the presentation, so you can see the numbers. So, we -- the CECL adoption impact and wholesale was a net release. And so, we've now build that, and so that's why you see that dynamic there. And then in terms of the reserving, when we close the books, which was here in early April, we do have to, of course, kind of snap the chalk line at some points and close the books, which is why we wanted to be very transparent about how we think about reserving going forward. Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we're looking at, that we would expect to have a build in the second quarter and perhaps beyond. Because as I said, obviously, everyone is incredibly fluid and we need too. We really need to learn a lot about the ultimate impact of these programs because they are extraordinary and should have an extraordinary impact. But we need some time to learn.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd also, just to add on the wholesale side, kind of at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrades and stuff like that. It will also be name-by-name; company-by-company, name-by-name, reserve-by-reserve. So, real detailed review of that.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystSo as, as we think through -- because effectively, I think, what we're saying is there is the possibility of the severely adverse case coming which we can look back at prior Fed stress tests to see what you anticipated that to mean for the credit losses. And maybe, Jamie, if you get an understanding as to how you're thinking about what your comments are looking for versus prior severely adverse stress cases that you have run on your own bank. Is it fair to look at the severely adverse stress cases on a bank run modeling basis that we have access to and it's in line with that kind of level? Or is this something that's even a little bit tougher -- and specifically around like things like commercial real estate? I get the name-by-name on the corporate side, that that is obviously extraordinarily granular, and you have access to that. But I'm wondering on the commercial real estate side, is there anything we should be thinking about that's different from perhaps what the Fed stress test might have suggested in the past?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think commercial real estate, eventually, it will be loan-by-loan and name-by-name too. So, if you have reason to believe the loan is bad, you're going to write it down and put a reserve against it or something like that. This is such a dramatic change of events, so there are no models that have done -- dealt with GDP down 40%, unemployment growing this rapidly, and that's one part. And also, no models have ever dealt with a government which is doing a PPP program which might be $350 billion and might be $550 billion. Unemployment, it looks like 30% to 40% of people on unemployment were of higher income than before they went on unemployment.




So, what does that mean for credit card or something like that, or that the government is going to make direct payments to people? So, this is all in the works right now. The company is in very good shape. We can serve our clients and we're going to give you more detail on this, but it's happening as we speak. And I think people are making too much of mistakes trying to model it. When we get to the end of the second quarter, we'll know exactly what happened in the second quarter. Like, you got to expect that credit card delinquencies and charges will go up. But we see very little of it so far. But by the end of the second quarter you'll see more of it. And then we'll also know if there's a fourth round of government stimulus. We'll know a whole bunch of stuff and we'll report it out. We hope for the best, which is you have that recovery, and plan for the worst so you can handle it.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And then in terms of planning for the worst, Betsy, maybe it'd be helpful, the extreme adverse scenario that Jamie referenced in his Chairman's letter had 2020 credit cost of more than $45 billion. So, clearly that is not our central case. But that's the kind of scenario that we are making sure that we're prepared for. And then just coincidentally, if you look at our credit costs from the fourth quarter of '08 to the fourth quarter of '09, across those five quarters, we had credit cost of $47 billion.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Right. And I've got the number where the reserves went from like $7 billion to $35 billion back to $14 billion.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerRight.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Reserve in itself is pro-cyclical and often wrong. And you're required to do it, but it certainly doesn't match revenues and expenses. And so, we'd like to be conservative in reserving, but I have to point out the flaws of it.OperatorOur next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst




Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions. Again, one on CECL maybe to start with. Can you just maybe give a little bit more qualitative disclosure on how this payment relief factors in? I mean, are you assuming some amount of government programs get used and that's included or that's just payment relief that you're directly giving to consumers and corporates? Just trying to get a sense of how all these government programs are going to flow through the model.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, Brian. So, you can think about the government stimulus as being incorporated in the macroeconomic variables. And then the payment release, those are -- I'm referring to our own programs there. And there we, based upon our judgment and experience in the past, we apply some percentage of pull through in the portfolio of people who will get payment release, and then we think about the impact that that could have.Again, I would say, both, while estimated for the first quarter, we'll know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter.




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd, Jen, remind me, when we do the 10-Q for the quarter, we're going to lay out lots of these various assumption about CECL. And one of the problems of CECL is this precisely. We're going to spend all day on CECL, which was $4 billion and it's kind of a drop in the bucket, but it's a lot of data. It's like all the data we did after the last crisis, we give you on Level 3 and all these assumption and stuff like that. No one ever looks at it anymore.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right.




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd every company does it differently.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And we still have obviously several weeks before the Q. And so, we'll be able to give our best view on things then.




Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystOkay. And then in the quarter, is there, I mean, the marks were on the bridge loan. But is there a way to frame what the total marks were, I mean, assuming credit spreads tightened kind of dramatically post quarter end, so it seems like there would be a reversal of some of those marks initially?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, there could be. But that's only where we are at this point in the quarter. And so, it will obviously all depend on the market from now to the end of the quarter. But right now, the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in, as you mentioned.




James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerA couple of deals may be syndicated, hopefully might be syndicated at the end of the second or third quarter.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.




Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- AnalystYes, good morning. Thank you. At Investor Day, Jamie, you said that the real earnings, pre-provision earnings minus net charge-offs [Technical Issues].James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don't know about you guys, we can't understand a word he's saying.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Chris, this is unfortunately part of our -- all of our new reality is we all work remotely. We couldn't hear you.Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- AnalystOkay. Is this better?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- AnalystOkay. So, my apologies. At Investor Day, Jamie said something like that the real economic earnings are pre-provision earnings minus net charge-offs, and so which I agree with. And so, if you push aside all the CECL reserving noise, I'm curious, does the customer relief, the 90-day grace period, does that change the -- alter the historic charge-off assumptions? Like, for example, I mean, credit cards was always pretty cookie cutter, 180 days after delinquency, it's charged off; and maybe with Auto or -- will those customer relief periods push back the charge-off curve as well?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerIt may. Because as long as the customer is performing under the forbearance program, they are not delinquent. But, of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll surely know a lot more in 90 days.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll surely know a lot more in 90 days about how this affected, what we would have expected.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, and to Jamie's point, what we may learn over the next 90 days is, of course, whether programs have been effective or were they just delayed losses. And of course, with CECL being life of loan, if it's just delayed losses, you can expect that that would, we would be reserving for that.Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- AnalystOkay. But in terms of charge-offs, the [Technical Issues] am I getting that right?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerIt may be. It may be. But again, it's going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or a forbearance program.We don't really think about it that way. We think about what the ultimate losses will be, and we reserve for that. But -- and then importantly, in the first quarter, the chart [Phonetic] that you're seeing, which is why I was clear to say it was consistent with prior expectations because the charge-offs in the first quarter of course don't at all reflect the ultimate impact of COVID-19. They were just normal BAU, I would say.Operator




Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soc Gen.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So firstly, on government guaranteed loans, these are 0% risk-weighted; and I'm wondering to what extent you're using them to refinance existing loans on your portfolios? And if you are, to what extent risk-weighted assets have gone through if you do those?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Yes. So, I'm not sure specifically what program you're referring to. I would just say broadly speaking on the Fed facilities, they're obviously very large programs rolled out very quickly and just an extraordinary response to unprecedented market conditions. Here, we are happy to leverage the facilities to intermediate these programs for our clients, but we are only using them where it makes sense to ensure credit and liquidity is flowing to where it's needed.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystSo, I mean just to maybe elaborate on that, is there maybe some part where there is a bit of a capital uplift if you use government guaranteed loans that are 0% risk-weighting where previously --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




What uplift?Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystA capital uplift, so your risk-weighted assets go down, say, for some something like loans that are government guaranteed --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




We'll incorporate all of that into how we run the company, trying to serve the client etc. And there are few things here, like the PPP, you put in your balance sheet is zero RWA. But it does affect a lot of other things like SLR and G-SIFI and stuff like that. Whereas if you sell it to the government, it all goes away. And we'll manage through that as we learn if these programs [Phonetic] are working and what we want to do.OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Okay. Thanks, everyone.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you for spending time with us.Operator

Prepared Remarks:
OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation, please standby.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.5 billion, EPS of $2.57, and revenue of $29.2 billion, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Underlying performance continues to be strong. Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across Consumer and Wholesale with average balances up 7% year-on-year.We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the Company were up 3% year-on-year, excluding the impact of home lending loan sales from prior quarters.Client investment assets in Consumer & Business Banking were up 27% and Asset and Wealth Management, AUM, was up 19%, reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic growth. We ranked Number one for the full year in global IB fees with 9% wallet share and growth IB revenue in the Commercial Bank was a record $2.7 billion.




In CIB markets, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year. However, it's important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms, in fact a record fourth quarter. And credit performance continues to be strong across the Company.On to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII. Non-interest revenue was up $2.6 billion or 21% on higher revenue in CIB markets and AWM and continued strong performance in home lending and auto.Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 4% on volume and revenue-related costs. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations.Turning to the full-year results on Page 3; the firm reported net income of $36.4 billion with EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion, all records and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Revenue was up $7.2 billion or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Non-interest revenue was up $5.1 billion or 9%, driven by growth across Consumer and higher CIB markets revenue and expenses of $65.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue-related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.




Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year. And on credit, performance remained strong throughout 2019. Credit costs were $5.6 billion. In Consumer, credit costs were up $210 million reflecting an increase in card due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit costs in home lending,. And in wholesale, we were up $504 million, largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in 2018.Moving to the balance sheet and capital, on Page 4; we ended the fourth quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. And while on the topic of capital, it's worth noting, given the actions we have taken, we fully expect that we will remain in the 3.5% GSIB bucket.Before we move into the business results, I'll spend a moment talking about CECL on Page 5. As you know, the transition to CECL was effective on January 1st and therefore there is no impact to our 2019 financials. On the page is the CECL adoption impact and overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion, which is at the lower end of the range we provided.This was driven by an increase in consumer of $5.7 billion mostly coming from card, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale of $1.4 billion. In Cards, the increase is a result of moving to lifetime loss coverage versus a shorter loss emergence period under the current model, whereas in wholesale, modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecasts versus through-the-cycle loss rates under-incurred result in a decrease, especially given the forecast of credit environment.




Recognition of the allowance increase has resulted in a $2.7 billion after-tax decrease to retained earnings, as you can see on the page. Also important to note, we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital.And now turning to the businesses, we'll start with Consumer Community Banking on Page 6. In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%, client investment assets up 27% and total loans down 6%. For the full year, results in CCB were strong with $16.6 billion of net income, up 12% and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $55.9 billion, up 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year.In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher non-interest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as account and transaction growth. Home Lending revenue was down 5%, driven by lower NII on lower balances which were down 17% reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue, reflecting a 94% increase in origination.And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto; revenue was up 9% driven by higher card NII on loan growth as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Cards loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 2%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, including market expansion, largely offset by expense efficiencies.




On Credit, this quarter's CCB had a net reserve release of a $150 million. This included a release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of $100 million driven by growth. Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion largely driven by card and consistent with expectations.Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7; for the fourth quarter, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year. For the full year, CIB delivered record revenue of $38 billion and an ROE of 14%. In Investment Banking, IB fees reached an all-time record for the full year.We maintained our number one rank in global IB fees and grew share to its highest level in the decade. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 million was up 6% year on year, outperforming the market which was flat. Advisory fees were down 3% following a record performance last year.On a sequential-quarter basis, fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions, and for the year, we ranked number two and gained share. Debt underwriting fees were up 11% year-on-year due to higher bond issuance activity as clients accelerated their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance sheets.




And for the year, we maintained our number one rank overall and we were number one from these acquisitions in both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America.The new issuance market continue to be active, and for the year we ranked number one in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy and strategic dialogs with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance.Moving to markets; total revenue was $5 billion, up 56% year-on-year, driven by record fourth quarter revenues in both fixed income and equity markets. Fixed income markets was up 86% benefiting from a favorable comparison against the challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses, notably in securitized type products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows.Equity markets was up 15% driven by strength across cash and prime. Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, down 3% year-on-year primarily due to deposit margin compression, which was largely offset by organic growth. While Security services revenue was $1.1 billion [Phonetic], up 3%. Expenses of $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal, volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investment.




Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8; Commercial Banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROE of 16% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower margins, largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on the strategic investments.Gross investment banking revenues were $634 million, up 5% year-on-year, driven by increased large-scale activity. Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion, up 10% on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking. Expenses of $882 million were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investment in banker coverage and technology.Deposit balances were up 8% year-on-year as we continue to see strong client flows. Loan balances were up 1% year-on-year. C&I loans were up 2% driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion markets, partially offset by the run-off in our tax exempt portfolio. CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher originations in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.Finally, credit costs were $110 million and NPL rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by single names which was reserved for in prior quarters. Underlying credit performance continues to be strong.




Now on to Asset Wealth Management on Page 9; Asset Wealth Management reported net income of $785 million with pre-tax margin of 28% and ROE of 29% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, AWM generated net income of $2.8 billion with both pre-tax margin and ROE of 26%. Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year. And for the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $14 billion driven by fixed income and multi-asset and we had net liquidity inflows of $37 billion. AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client asset of $3.2 trillion, both records, were up 19% and 18% respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products. Deposits were up 8% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. And finally, we had record loan balances, up 8% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending.Now on to Corporate on Page 10; Corporate reported a net loss of $361 million. Revenue was a loss of $228 million for the current quarter, driven by approximately $190 million of net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments. Sequentially, revenue was down $920 million due to lower rates, the benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales, as wells as the PE losses I just mentioned. Year-on-year revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates. Expenses of $343 million were down $165 million year-on-year due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year.And turning to Page 11 for the outlook; at Investor Day, as always, we'll give you more information on the full-year outlook. However, for now, I'll provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. We expect NII to be approximately $14 billion, market-dependent; adjusted expenses to be about $17 billion. And as a reminder, the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments, and as a result, it's currently estimated to be approximately 17% since the managed tax rate is about 500 basis points to 700 basis points higher.




So to wrap up; 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenue, net income and EPS. Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive, underpinned by the strength of the U.S. Consumer. And despite expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well positioned as we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business model.And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Ken.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks, good morning. Hi, Jen, how are you? Jen, I was wondering if -- in terms of the NII outlook, you talked about the $14 billion level, obviously getting to a point of stability. Can you help us -- outside of day count, can you help us understand just where we are in terms of repricing of the balance sheet? What happens if rates generally stay flat from here, just in terms of rate side of the equation, if we hold volume aside?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. As we look at rates paid, on the retail side, we didn't obviously have repriced on the way up. And so there is little to do on the way down. In fact there from a rate paid perspective, we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates paid tick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs.And then on the wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down, as you would expect and we did see betas accelerate after the second cut. So there we saw more, more of a decline in CIB than we did in CB or AWM as you might expect. Importantly though, as we always say on the wholesale side, we price client-by-client. And so we're not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta.And then, I would just say, in terms of the outlook, with the Fed on hold, the implied do still had one cut later in 2020. And based on the latest implied, we'll give you more detail at Investor Day, as we always do, but I would say NII for the full year of 2020, flat to slightly down as the headwinds from rates will be offset with balanced growth.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah, got it. And just one question on just the volume side of things, ex the mortgage loans, sales last year, you were still in that like 3% core growth and obviously you talk a lot about this, the environment and how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level. Just, what's the status at just corporate and commercial customers now that we're closer to Phase 1 getting finalized, UMCA [Phonetic] is on the table? What's the -- what's the backdrop of just economic activity as you guys see it.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, the fourth quarter definitely, I would say, stabilized. Things trade certainly stabilized. Things, broadly speaking, stopped getting worse and so, we saw sentiment improve a bit, which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter. And then, certainly there are some puts and takes. I mean the U.S. consumer remains in very strong shape both from a credit perspective sentiment spending. Obviously labor market is very strong and the Fed and the ECB on hold, and then capital spending is still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least, certainly better than it was six months ago. So we have a, broadly speaking, constructive outlook headed -- as we're heading into 2020 here.




OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystHi, good morning. I have a question on credit and CECL. And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcome -- economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes and -- but CECL does materially change the way in which timing -- change the timing in which earnings accrete to book value and capital, obviously with a higher upfront hit. But you guys have also been shifting your loan book pretty materially toward cards, which have a much higher loss content than your total book.




So I guess a two-fold question. One is, how do we think about provisioning in this context, should we think provisioning is going to be well above charge-offs as your reserve ratio moves up, because I would think your ALLL ratio post CECL adoption, which is I think is about 1.8 1.9, it should move up as cards, which have a much higher loss content and that continue to grow in the mix. So just how do we think about provisioning in the context of the mix shift and CECL's adoption?And then, I guess secondly, if there is a change in the macro environment and the credit environment does get worse and if CECL -- that inflection goes to your reserves and your provisioning, is there a point where CECL actually does change the way you think about pricing and underwriting in that environment?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I'll start with the provisioning. So look, I think it's fair to say under CECL you could have incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macroeconomic forecasts. But there, that would depend of course on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extents of those downturn.




in Cards specifically, as you say, in any one period of growth or a downturn, you could see an increase in reserve in the sense that we're taking life of loan versus the next nine or 12 months. So, that's true.And then on the Wholesale side, you could see some differences of course, because there are modeling differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through the cycles. Having said that, we continue to believe [Phonetic] that that incremental volatility would be material for us. And of course net charge-offs are not changing. And then from a price perspective, we don't foresee in the near term any pricing changes. The cash flows with the customer have not changed. And so we don't see any, but it is true, as you rightly pointed out that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that we're taking reserves upfront versus through time. So over time you could see that, but we're not expecting it in the near term.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystGot it. I guess on the provisioning side. My question is more just on an ongoing basis is the mix changes more toward higher loss content lending, which obviously has higher margins and higher profitability through the -- over the course of the loan. But like in that context, I would -- is it fair to say your provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs because I would think that your reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios do have to move up as that mix changes on your balance sheet it?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerIt could be -- it could be important. So that's just timing, particularly on the card side, it's just timing. But it's difficult to know, again, because it relies on our ability to have perfect foresight into the timing and extent of a downturn.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystGot it. No, that's fair. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Erika.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo, I was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results. Understand that obviously the fourth quarter ' 18 comp was light, but $3.4 billion is still a pretty heavy number for a fourth quarter for JPMorgan. So, any color you could provide would be very helpful Jennifer?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So you're taking about markets, Erika?




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystMarkets, thank you.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Okay, sure. So there -- at Goldman, in early December, I did say we expect it to be up meaningfully. I would say the performance was broad based. In rates we call out securitized products -- I'm sorry, in fixed income, we call out securitized products in rates which were bright spots. But broadly speaking, obviously equities had a very strong quarter as well. So it's really across the franchise and we saw very strong client flow and we had $0.06 monetizing those flows, so just a very healthy environment for us and really strong performance.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGot it. My follow-up question is that a quarter ago or -- and two quarters ago, the revenue backdrop for banks in general, when the outlook was starting to deteriorate. And I think management had got -- gave us some color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives, no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment. But you could cut back on certain expenses if revenue environment was changing. That being said, your revenue production seems to always outperform to the upside. So as you think about 2020, is the best way to think about expense is just at 55% overhead ratio?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo look, on the efficiency ratio, I would say that, we run the Company with great discipline, whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle. But because the efficiency ratio is an outcome, not an input and is about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any one year. We think about operating leverage over time and as we always say we're not going to change the way we run the Company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds.




And on expenses, I would just say that at Investor Day last year, Marianne told you that we expected the cost curve to flatten post 2019 and 2019 adjusted expenses were up 3%. 2020, we expect them to be up less than that.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




Hi.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




Is Jamie on the call?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




I'm sorry?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, he is. Yeah.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




Okay. So I just -- a question for Jamie, because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity and I know this is a very simple question, but can you talk about the connection between easing trade issues and better trading and you said that was better toward the end of the year. Is this something that you expect to remain or is this a one-off quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, that's a hard question, Mike. So the obviously [Indecipherable] a lot of consternation that has eased off a little bit. I don't think we seen it completely go away. So you still have potential ongoing trade issues with China and Europe and stuff like that. But I think because that sentiment got better trading got better. But for how long that continues, we don't know.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




And then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3%, it should be less than that this year. You guys had also mentioned that your technology spending might be leveling off. So as that levels off maybe you see paybacks from prior investment, any sense of where tech spending will be this year versus the prior year and how you think about that. And I know we'll get more at Investor Day.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, of course. So I think you can think about tech spendings on a fully loaded basis being in line with what I described for the company. And we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech. but as you well know, we continuously invest in tech and so there is a fair amount of velocity in the investment portfolio there as investments roll off and we're investing in technology and innovation. So you can think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how I describe the Company in terms of trend.Operator




Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Hi Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystTwo questions, one on asset growth. In the last couple of years fourth quarter, you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the GSIB target. And then in addition, this year, I think you sold some residential mortgage loans to investors or at least the investors are taking the risk of it and then you're requesting to have regulatory capital reflect that transfer of risk to an investor pool while you're keeping the customer relationship.When I see these things, I'm wondering how you're thinking about how much room you have for asset growth as we go into 2020 and is there an opportunity to potentially do more of this residential mortgage loan trade to free up space for growth. Maybe you could speak to that.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I mean we're bound by the standardized capital and so, of course, that is a consideration for us and one of the reasons that we're looking to structure loan sales as you described in the mortgage business. So we think that there is more we can do there. And then on GSIB, we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the Fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult. So, both are, at the margins, constraints for us, But broadly speaking, I wouldn't say that we're constrained given where we are on our capital ratios.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd as I think about CECL, appreciate the commentary you had earlier on the call. I'm just wondering, a couple of things; one, why do you think you ended up toward the low end of your $4 billion to $6 billion increase in reserves that you outlined earlier. And what kind of estimates you have for the economic outlook? You've got the assumption for the economic outlook in the reasonable supportable period etc. And so, I'm just trying to understand what kind of forecast you have in your model so that I understand what's embedded in your scenarios and in your ALR ratio?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, we -- I think we ended up at the low end, as we -- through the year, continue to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like. And so I think that's really what's driving it. Obviously, portfolio mix as well continue to be very strong in terms of performance of the portfolio.And then, on the estimates for the economic outlook, as you rightly say, there is the reasonable and supportable period which for us is two years. And so, we do use multiple weighted scenario there. So we weight multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight and that's where you went up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period which also obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




And Jen, are we going to disclose some of those variables over time?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officerthat's a great point Jamie. I should have said that. Yes, we -- I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q for the first quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Which means all the banks will be showing these ridiculous forecasting going forward and the differences and we'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerRight.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




But we'll disclose it. You need to know to make it clear what we're doing and why we're doing it.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right. So you'll see more in the Qs.Operator




Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Hi Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystTwo quick follow-ups to some themes that have been talked about. I guess first on expenses, the full-year outlook was pretty clear. Less than 3% growth, but the first quarters seems a little bit higher than maybe I would have thought, up 4% year-over-year and I don't know if that's just rounding and I'm getting too obsessed over $100 million here or there or if you are upfronting some investment spend, and if so what that's for?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So, the first quarter tend to be a bit higher for us, if you look through history and so -- but there, you can think about it, comparing it year-over-year. We have volume and revenue related expenses increasing, a bit of an increase on investments, but both are being partially offset by expense efficiency.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay. And then the other follow-up question is just on capital allocation. Obviously, it's a good problem to have. But the ratio just keep going up, the capital generation keeps going up. The stock keeps going up. You're obviously buying back a lot of stock. The goal is to get the dividend, I think, higher over time. But maybe just talk about how you think about buying back stock at these levels. If there is other call it, creative uses of capital. Like, I would think about all the money you spend on technology. Does it make sense to buy technology versus do it organic? So, just maybe address some of those things. Thank you.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So on that ratio, I'll just remind you that of course we have our capital distribution plan approved once a year. And so since our last CCAR filing, we have realized some RWA efficiency and we've out-earned relative to the assumptions in the CCAR filings. And so that's part of the reason why we've seen the ratios load up there.On stock buybacks, you know as you rightly point out, our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic growth. And so we are always looking to do that, first and foremost. And then, to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then do distribute excess capital to shareholders through buybacks and we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above 2 times tangible book which is about where we are now.We will obviously, when distributing excess capital, always be looking at the alternatives. But at a 17% ROTCE and 2% or 3% dividend payout ratio, there is a high bar to the alternative.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




And yeah, you're absolutely right about acquisitions, we did do InstaMed this year, which hooks up electronics -- InstaMed hooks up providers and consumers of healthcare, while, I think the numbers are like 80% or 90% is still done by check. So if there are opportunities like that, we absolutely will be on hunt for them.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right, WePay last year. Yeah.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




And WePay the year before.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Operator




Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystHi Jennifer.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Hi Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystA question on credit, you obviously put up some really good numbers, once again, on credit quality and I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale non-performing assets quarter-to-quarter. Can you give us any color on what brought that down and could you tie in also any concerns that you may have about the energy portfolio. I know it's not material, but there is some concerns out there about energy credits.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So, on wholesale non-performing loans in the CIB. That was some name-specific upgrades that we had in the CIB. And then in the commercial bank that was related to charge-offs taken in the quarter. And then, on energy, really nothing there semantically, I would say like any sector we have upgrades and downgrades and this quarter was no exception. But I wouldn't say anything semantically in our portfolio that we're concerned about.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good. And then, I don't know if I heard you correctly on the last answer to the stock repurchase program. I understand of course it's driven by your CCAR results. But if the price of the stock, and that's a good problem to have, gets to a level that you consider to be too high.I think you may have said 2 times tangible book value, what then happens if the price, if it gets to a point where you guys think it's just too high to buy it back, what do you do with the excess capital at that point? Have you given that much -- and again, that's a good problem to have. I understand that. But have you given any thought to that?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, we give a lot of thought to it. And I agree, it is a high-class problem. And so, we said that at or above two times tangible book makes sense. If it continues to go up, we're going to continue to look at alternatives. Most importantly, within the Company in terms of how we should really think about the returns on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit differently in terms of organic growth. Jamie, I don't know if there is anything you want to add?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, you said it all.




OperatorOur next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, good morning. So Jennifer, wanted to start with a question on capital. Quarles indicated in a recent interview that he plans to implement the bulk of the SEB in 2020 CCAR. Also alluded to the possibility of deploying a counter-cyclical buffer as part of that. I'm just wondering if the counter-cyclical buffer is actually deployed or incorporated within the test. Is that something that's underwritten as part of your 12% CET1 target and are you anticipating changes to the GSIB coefficient calculations that you alluded to earlier in the call as part of the coming cycle as well.




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Steven. So, I mean, you touched on a number of things that are all important and I think what's most important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them. The comment from the Vice-Chair has been constructive in the sense that he always reiterate that he thinks the level of capital in the system is about right. And so we'll have a firmer view when we see a final rule. As you say, we do expect to see something in 2020 based upon the comments that we have heard, just like you have and we expect that our 12% target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the Vice Chair say over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right. And then, but we didn't have a firm view until we see the final rule.And then, on GSIB we remain hopeful that we're going to see the refinements that the Fed has been talking about, perhaps not full recalibration until Basel IV, which is what the Vice Chair recently said. But, certainly, there are a number of refinements that we've been talking about and the Fed has been talking about for year and that we remain hopeful that we'll see them very soon.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst




Thanks for that color. Jennifer. And just one final one from me. We saw really strong FIC results as well as really strong institutional deposit growth. I was hoping you could speak to what impact the Fed balance sheet growth is actually having on all of your different businesses or how that's manifesting, because it seems to be providing a pretty nice tailwind whether it's some increased activity as well as some benefit in terms of deposit growth that you're seeing across the overall franchise but institutional in particular.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So you're absolutely right. On the wholesale side, the Fed balance sheet extension was for sure a tailwind for us, although I would say, the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the wholesale side in the quarter was from strong organic growth in client acquisition [Technical issue] was a tailwind. And elsewhere I would say, obviously it was the right thing to do and provided stability in the repo markets throughout the quarter.Operator




Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystHey, good morning. Quick question on the deposit costs, could you just break down maybe by segment where the big drivers were, that saw -- you saw have the big reduction in deposit costs linked-quarter. Was that in security services, was it the wealth management?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. Sure, Brian. So on that, I'll start with retail where we saw rates paid tick up a bit and that's on migration from savings to CDs. We have seen CD pricing come off its peak, but continuing migration from savings to CDs. And then, on the wholesale side, you see bigger declines in rates paid in treasury services for sure and then a little bit less so in the commercial bank and AWM.And again, as we always say, these are name specific client by client decisions. And while we feel good about where we are, these are decisions we make client by client and we're certainly careful and have a lot of discipline not going to lose valuable relationships over a few ticks of beta.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods -- AnalystAnd then, a separate question. In the Commercial Bank, I mean you're seeing loans come down quarter-on-quarter for end of period and generally modest growth year-over-year. I mean what's the sentiment now in the middle market and the corporate client. Is it a sentiment issue? Is it just timing issue there for seeing better loan growth?




Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So there are obviously some puts and takes which I'll run through, but broadly speaking, I would say, what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand. And in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused, in specialized industries and market expansion, but of course, that's offset partially by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off. And then in CRE, good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunity there, given the rate environment and then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined, given where we are in the cycle.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would just add. When capital expenditures come down, all things being equal, which they're not, but all things being equal, you're going to see a reduction in some lendings as companies need less money to pay off receivables and inventory and plant and equipment.




OperatorOur next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Glenn.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHello there, hi. A quick question on open APIs and what the big picture is here and how it impacts you and the rest of the banking industry meaning there is concerns over data security and things like that, but JPMorgan has some -- plenty of agreements with some of the bigger providers. I'm just curious to get your big picture thoughts on what level concern should we have and what's the good and the bad.Yeah. I mean there, I would say, Glenn, our customers' data privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. And we think over time the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have third-party apps only access data through our APIs. And so we are working name by name to get those agreements in place. And we hope, through time that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our customers' data. We think that's the most secure way to do it.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




But very importantly, is that, that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them is not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off as opposed to today, if you gave you bank passcode to someone, they're taking your data every day, maybe even every minute and you don't even know about it because you forgot.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerGreat point. And we're going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




So you will give them the tools to control that.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, you can imagine a dashboard, where they will have the...James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




That is the full intent.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




And then, just curious if you've seen any follow-on impacts that you've seen some repricing on parts of the illiquid markets and for specifically some of the unprofitable parts of those companies, and is that just the repricing and everybody that owns them will take some hits a little bit slower progress on banking front and that's it or is there anything bigger there to worry about with what's going on in the illiquid side.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAre you taking about the private companies?Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst




Yes, I am, sorry.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, look, there are a lot of private companies, lot of them do well, some don't, some have failed. Some have access to capital now and they wouldn't have access to capital in a downturn, but it's not a systemic issue. It's just -- in the capital market there are a lot of private companies and -- so I don't think it's that big a deal. You just have an adjustment in access to capital that will happen periodically.Operator




Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- AnalystThank you. Jennifer, you were kind of foreshadowing lower tax rate as you kind of move into the first quarter and then the tax rate here in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected. Is there anything that's permanent here or are there some things that are just kind of rolling through these two quarters?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Yeah, there -- I wouldn't say there's anything permanent there. The first quarter is typically lower for us Marty. You can think about full-year '20 as been 20% plus or minus, and of course that would depend on any non-recurring items we might have or any change in regulation. But 20% plus or minus, and then of course that managed tax rate is typically 500 to 700 basis points higher than that.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- AnalystAnd then a bigger question, when we came into 2018, the net interest margin was around 2.5% and then now as we are coming out of 2019, the net interest margin has fallen below 2.4%. So interest rates went up a 100 basis points and then down 75 basis points and we've netted down a negative 10 basis points. So I was just curious on that path, it's either the way the Fed kind of inflected very quickly that created a little bit more pressure in the net between deposit pricing a loan pricing or do we think that this is probably just some of the competition that came in after the tax reform and maybe this is just the evidence of some of that competition with the increased profitability that we got from the benefit from the taxes?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Yeah. So there, I would say Marty, on that -- sort of the last several hikes, there were some catch-up there because we know we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment. So if you're just looking at the last few high, the betas would certainly be higher than what we're seeing in terms of the first three eases here. But broadly speaking on NIM, I mean we don't -- NIM is an outcome for us, not an input and as we think about looking forward, certainly the environment is very competitive, it always has been. And NII, the outlook for 2020 is, at this point, based upon the implied flat to slightly down and we do expect balance sheet growth.OperatorOur next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst




Hi, morning, thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you can give a bit more color on your markets performance there, obviously it's done very well. Geographically though, is there much more weighting there on the U.S. versus Europe and APAC.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerI would say Andrew that it was broad based. We can have Jason and team follow up specifically on a geographic breakdown. But, but it was -- it was largely broad based.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst




Right. And would you say with confidence that you're gaining market share in both territories there?Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I don't have the split on market share by region, but Jason and team can certainly follow-up on that.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Yeah, I'm not sure we want to start disclosing that regularly. But I do believe the market share went up in -- pretty much in most markets, but you can't say most markets in all products.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Operator




And our next question is from Alison Williams of Bloomberg Intelligence.Alison Williams -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- AnalystGood morning. So I had a similar question, just circling back to trading and then CIB more broadly. So obviously, the bank has gained share, but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically, businesses like cash management, transaction banking and corporate clients in general. You're a leader in the U.S. Anecdotally we hear U.S. banks have been making gains in Europe. Can you speak at all to that opportunity.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




Sure. So as you said, we'll give you more color at Investor Day for the Treasury Services business. We feel really good about where we're positioned. I think going forward, there will obviously be some rate headwinds there, which we think can be offset by organic growth. But given the investments that we have made there, Jamie have mentioned InstaMed earlier. We feel really good about the capabilities that we're adding and what we're seeing in terms of organic growth there, but we can talk to you more about that at Investor Day.Alison Williams -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- AnalystOkay, thank you.Operator




And we have no further questions at this time.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerOkay. Thanks everyone.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Guys, we'll see you. Thank you. I'll see you guys tomorrow.Jennifer A. Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, see you tomorrow.Operator

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.77%)Q3 2019 Earnings CallOct 15, 2019, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please, go ahead.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.1 billion and EPS of $2.68 on record revenue of $30.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 18%. Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in home lending and auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in card; No. 1 in global IB fees year to date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in asset and wealth management, we saw record AUM and client assets. Overall, for the firm, total loans were flat year on year, which includes continued mortgage loan sales. SC sales loans were up 3% on healthy growth in card and AUM.Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail, and credit performance remained strong across business. On to Page 2, and some more detail about our third-quarter results. Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year on year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year on year or 14%, driven by strong performance across fixed income markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million. Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses, as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.5 billion, reflecting modest net reserve build and charge-offs in line with expectations. And as we mentioned last quarter, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale. Now on the balance sheet and capital on Page 3.




 We ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, up about 10 basis points versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.6 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. Now on to Page 4 for a look at our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking. CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year on year. Revenue of $14.3 billion was up 7% year on year. In consumer and business banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year on year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels. Revenue was up 5%, driven by higher NII on deposit growth and margin expansion as well as higher non-interest revenue on higher transaction volumes. And even though the deposit margin is higher year on year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter on quarter given the current rate environment. Home lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales. With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to home lending revenue is minimal with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from corporate. And in card, merchant services and auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion, as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, and merchant processing volume was up 11%. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year on year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build-in card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in home lending and $50 million in business banking. The build-in cards is primarily driven by mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio.




 Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, largely driven by card and consistent with expectations. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $2.8 billion and an ROE of 13% on revenue of $9.3 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year on year in a market that was down. It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory. Year to date, we continue to rank No. 1 in overall IB wallet and gain share across products and regions, benefiting from our leadership position in technology and healthcare sectors. In advisory, we were down 13% year on year, reflecting lower deal activity compared to a strong prior year. However, we continue to gain wallet share, driven by our strategic investments. In debt underwriting, we were up 17% year on year in a market that was down. Here, we benefited from our participation in some large transactions and increased activity in investment-grade bonds. In equity underwriting, we were up 22% year on year, significantly outperforming the market, driven by our strong performance in IPOs and convertibles. And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked No. 1 in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth-quarter IBCs to be down both sequentially and year on year driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year. However, the pipeline remains healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive.




 Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.1 billion, up 14% year on year. Fixed income markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year. This quarter was characterized by strong client activities across the board with outperformance in agency mortgage trading and improved flows in rates and commodities. Equity markets was down 5% against a very strong third quarter last year. Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year. Treasury services and securities services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 7% and 2% year on year, respectively. The rate environment remains a relative headwind, primarily from the funding basis compression we've been talking about, which is largely firmwide neutral, and to a lesser extent, client-specific repricing in treasury services. But importantly, the organic growth in fees and balances continues to be strong. Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges. And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades. Now moving on to commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of $937 million and an ROE of 16%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year on year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue due to strong investment banking performance. Gross investment banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year on year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market. Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year on year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges. Deposit balances were up 3% year on year on strong client flows.




 Loan balances were flat year on year across both C&I and CRE. In C&I, while we are seeing pockets of growth in select industries, like financial institutions, technology and energy, there continues to be significant runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in commercial term lending, it was largely offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points. Now on to asset and wealth management on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $668 million with pre-tax margin of 25% and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as the impact of higher average market levels, as well as deposit and loan growth were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year on year on continued investments in technology and advisors, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees. Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs, as well as reserve builds on loan growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $40 billion, driven by fixed income, and net liquidity inflows of $24 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels. Deposits were up 4% year on year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 7% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $393 million. Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year on year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix, as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates.




 This quarter also included small net gains in certain legacy private equity investments compared to approximately $200 million of net losses in the prior year. And expenses of $281 million were up $253 million year on year, primarily due to higher investments in technology and a prior year net legal benefit. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Our full-year outlook remains in line with previous guidance. We expect net interest income to come in slightly below $57.5 billion, based on the latest implieds; and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65.5 billion. So to wrap up, the U.S. economy is on solid footing. And while global growth is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Despite continued macro uncertainty and headwinds from the rate environment, this quarter showcases the diversification and scale of our business model. We remain well positioned to outperform in any environment, and we'll continue to strategically invest in our businesses. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.  Questions & Answers: Operator




[Operator instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious your take on everything that went on in the repo markets during the quarter, and I would love it if you could put it in the context of maybe the fourth quarter of last year. If I remember correctly, you stepped in, in the fourth quarter. So higher rates, threw money at it, made some more money, and it calmed the markets down. I'm curious what's different this quarter that, that did not happen. And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the markets to function better on a go-forward basis.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So if I remember correctly, you got to look at the concept of -- we have a checking account at the fed with a certain amount of cash in it. Last year, we had more cash than we needed for regulatory requirements. So repo rates went up, we went with the checking account which paid IOER into repo. Obviously makes sense, you make more money. But now the cash in the account, which is still huge. It's $120 billion in the morning, and it goes down to $60 billion during the course of the day and back to $120 billion at the end of the day. That cash, we believe, is required under resolution and recovery and liquidity stress testing. And therefore, we could not redeploy it into repo market, which we would've been happy to do. And I think it's up to regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account. And again, I look at this as technical. A lot of reasons why those balances dropped to where they were. I think a lot of banks are in the same position, by the way.




 But I think the real issue when you think about it, does that mean that we have bad markets because that's kind of hitting a red line in that checking account. You're also going to hit a red line in LCR, like HQLA, which cannot be redeployed either. So to me, that will be an issue when the time comes. And it's not about JPMorgan. JPMorgan declined -- in any event, it's about how the regulators want to manage the system and who they want to intermediate when the time comes.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third-quarter results.




Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Yes. I feel bad for whoever borrowed at 10%. OK. Just a quickie on NII. I heard you on the full-year '19 commentary, and I don't think that's surprising, maybe a little bit better. Have you done much repositioning on the balance sheet as we look forward in 2020, which is looking like an obviously lower rate backdrop? I want to ask you what your thoughts around 2020 NII, but I'd rather hear the soft call because I know you're not going to give it to us.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Well, I'll try. So in terms of balance sheet positioning, as you know, we have a negatively convexed balance sheet. We manage it in both directions. Some moves in interest rates are hedgeable and some are not. In a quarter like we just had, with the rally that we had, you would expect us to buy duration and we did. And so -- but in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full-year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter just under $14 billion. Frankly, that's not a bad place to start. There will be some puts and takes. Obviously, you would have to get the full run rate of the October cut because, of course, they're developing from the implieds, and then there's one more cut next year. But an offset to that, at least a partial offset to that, would be balance sheet growth and mix. So we'll give you more color on Investor Day, as we always do, and we'll be in a better position then. But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.Operator




Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, one on your GSIB bucket. I know, as of the end of June, it showed that you had bumped up into the next GSIB bucket, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing that as we go into year end. And is there a plan to get back down? And how would you effect that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So as it relates to GSIB, we fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year end. As you know, most aspects of GSIB are on a spot basis, so we will manage it like we do any scarce resource and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year end.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 But is there -- does that impact just your market position in general? Is there anything that you would be looking to doing to get there that might reduce your positioning in some of the businesses that you're involved in, for example, things like derivatives, etc.? Or is it really not? Is it going to be something that we're not going to see in the revenues because it's too small to matter to you?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I couldn't say.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. What we need to do across the various GSIB buckets will not be obvious in our fourth-quarter results. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket. It's more than just leverage.OperatorOur next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Yes. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Glenn's question. As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I said we have $120 billion in our checking accounts with the fed, and it goes down to $60 billion and then back to $120 during the average day. But we believe the requirement under CLAR and resolution recovery is that when we'd opened that account such that if there's extreme stress, during the course of day, it doesn't go below zero. You go back to before the crisis you go below zero all the time during the day. So the question is, how far is that as a red line was the intent to regulate to a CLAR resolution to lock up that much of reserves in account of fed. And that will be up for regulators to decide. But right now, we have to meet those rules. And we don't want to violate anything we told them we're going to do.




Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. And as my follow-up, Jen, if -- you said something about the offset to the two fed cuts that are in the forward curve would be balance sheet growth and mix. Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and a 22% increase in investment securities balances?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. I think -- well, I'll come back to investment securities balances. But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think about largely in deposits. And just as one example, obviously, the rate environment and the economy will matter a whole lot.




 But just in a declining rate environment, the higher-yielding alternatives for consumers are less attractive. And so we do expect to continue to grow the franchise. And we could see healthy growth in the deposit base. So that's what I was referring to.In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on. As I said earlier, we did buy duration. But importantly, what you see in investment securities are also cash deployment strategies, as well as actions we took on the back of the mortgage loan sales. So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer In some cases, securities at a higher return on standardized capital than certain mortgage loans did.




OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So you, I guess, lowered your guidance for NII, but also lowered your guidance for expenses. So how much of that lower expense guidance is due to the deployment of technology? Or just more generally, at every Investor Day, you tell us you're going to spend, what, $12 billion on technology. And we don't really have a lot of insight into the traction that those technology investments are getting.




 So what's working technology-wise? What's not working? And how much of that can contribute to your improved expense guidance?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Sure. So I'll start, and if you want to add. So I would say, Mike, the NII guidance is not lower. At the second quarter, we said $57.5 billion, plus or minus. At the time, the implieds said three rate cuts: July, September, and December. And we said if there were two or more, that would be $57.5 billion minus; and if less than that, perhaps $57.5 billion plus. And so we are kind of right where we said we would be.




 And we're a little bit higher than what we said earlier in September at Barclays, and that's because we got a little bit of a tailwind on the 10-year and some balanced growth and one less cut in December. So I would say NII guidance broadly in line. On expenses in technology, there's a few things you can think about. First of all, broadly speaking, on expenses, I would say we remain committed to what we said at Investor Day in terms of the cost curve flattening from here. But importantly, you have to look at the underlying story, which I know is what you're getting at, which is there are volume or revenue-related expenses. And we're always looking for productivity there, and -- but they will be what they will be. They will come with top line growth. In terms of investments, we will continue with the discipline we always have around business cases and net present value and payback periods. But we will also always invest in the things we think we need to need to, even if they're a table fix. And so -- and then there's productivity, which is your point. And so we continue to realize productivity in our investments, and we continue to think we have opportunity ahead. We haven't laid that out in terms of quantifying it, but some of the things you can think about are robotics replacing repetitive processes. You can think about machine learning or AI in fraud. So machine learning assisting us in decision-making processes. Our call centers are always getting more productive. As Gordon said at Investor Day, our cost to serve in the consumer businesses are down 15%.




 And then digital capabilities that we're rolling out to our customers in terms of self-service is not only better for them, but more efficient for us. And so we have realized significant productivity to date in not only in our technology investments, but other investments and think still have room to run.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer As you said, in our merchant processing systems, and API store for the CIB. The stuff we built to hooking all that into our custody business. So you can go business by business and see the extensive amount of stuff we're rolling out, and it's pretty good.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 All right. Let me have one follow-up then. So I mean how many call center personnel do you have? Or how many data centers do you have? And how does that compare to the peak?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We're building many data centers as we speak. I forgot the total number, but it's quite a few. The new ones will be better, more efficient and more expandable and safe and more secure, all that kind of stuff. And we have to build that infrastructure. We have the best in the world. So we're not going to ever scrimp on something like that. And maybe at Investor Day, we can go a little bit more into how we try to manage the technology budget.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people. We think about the productivity of the people. So the number of calls that they are able to take because you may have more people because of more volume, but that's good, healthy volume with top line growth. But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. And with all the cyber stuff you read about, our fraud in cards and consumers come down, not gone up because of some of these deployed technologies in call centers. I would take you through all of them, but then we're telling them bad guys our secrets. But there are a lot of ways to stop some of the bad guys now.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst




 Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I'll start of with sort of a broader question on just the macro outlook. I think, Jen, you mentioned you feel the economy -- the U.S. economy is on sound footing, the consumer is obviously strong, but we are seeing some softening in the economic data. What are you hearing from clients? What are they telling you about whether they're concerned or whether there's increasing concern on policy, macro uncertainties? And how you're thinking about that going forward?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty. But broadly speaking, while it's slower growth, it's still growth. As I said, the U.S.




 consumer is incredibly strong. Consumer spending is strong. Sentiment is strong, so the consumer credit is good. And it is true that if you look at the ISM surveys, both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, they were recently disappointing. So I would say, no doubt, cautionary signs, but credit remains very good, and there's still very healthy business activity.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst OK. Great. That's helpful. On NII, just going back to NII, specifically in the CCB, if you adjust for the $350 million, actually, grew sequentially, which was a pretty strong result.




 And I know guidance is at the consolidated level. But how do we think about the glide path in that business going forward and some of the puts and takes? Deposit pricing came in a little bit at the consolidated level. I suspect some of that is commercial. But how do we think about that business and the NII trajectory? And is it possible that you can continue to grow that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I mean, there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds, as the implieds play out. We're not immune to that. But as I said earlier, there is at least a partial offset to that in growth. And so we still feel very good about the underlying growth that we're seeing there. And then just in terms of reprice, obviously, there's very little movement on the back of the SEBIs, given there's very little movement on the way up. And in fact, quarter over quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest-bearing. But we love the platform. The branch expansion is going very, very well.




 And so we feel great about the continued growth there, but we won't be immune to rate headwinds.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 Can you guys give us some additional color on the investment banking backlog that you may have at the end of the third quarter? And then second, if you take a look at the success that you had investment banking grabbing more wallet share, is it coming here in North America or in Asia? Can you give us some color there as well?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So on the IB pipeline, I would say it's healthy, although we do expect to be down in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year on year, on very strong performances in the third quarter, as well as the fourth quarter of last year. But overall, it feels healthy. And I would say, geographically, largely some strength in the U.S.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst




 And then following up in the markets business, again, you had good numbers. How important is the technology spending that you've been doing in markets leading to grabbing more wallet share in both equity and FICC?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think it's critical. If you walk on the trading floor today, the deployment of technology in automated trading algorithms in swaps and FX and equities, it's making its way into corporate buying. But I think it's critical you keep up with the technology in a very competitive business where market share matters.Operator




Our next question is from Eric Compton of MorningStar.Eric Compton -- Morningstar -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to step back and real big picture here. I mean net interest income, you're already starting to see some pressure there. Just I think the general commentary in the industry is the banks are just under pressure seemingly almost everywhere. You got to focus on expenses. And yet, you guys are still hitting returns on tangible at 18%. So just stepping back, I mean, you still have a couple of billion to play with before you even start getting to that 17% long-term goal level. Like what worries you about potentially pushing you under that 17% level? It just seems like even with all the pressures in the industry, you're still even exceeding it.




 Other than onetime credit events really -- I guess stepping back, what worries you about pushing the bank to that or even below that from your perspective?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And again, I think that you're overdoing the pressures on the banking industry. OK. Because we've had growth in the United States for the better part of 10 years. And I'd say that the credit is extraordinarily good. So if you look at consumer credit, commercial credit, wholesale, it's extraordinarily good. It can only get worse if you have a cycle. So our 17% is -- we always sort of play just through the cycle. We are at the over-earning part of the cycle in credit today.




 At one point, we'll be at the underearning part on credit. And of course, if you have a recession, it affects volumes and all these sort of things. So that's right -- that 17% is through the cycle and, frankly, not that bad.OperatorOur next question is from Marlin Mosby of Vining Sparks.Marlin Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- Analyst




 Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to ask you two kinds of different venues of questions. First, is if you look at the balance sheet, security yields came down pretty significantly this quarter. Just wondered how much you had in premium amortization that was embedded in that. And then as you look at the interest-bearing deposit cost, we didn't get much traction on the first cut. But did you get a little bit more traction on lowering those rates as you went into the -- going into the fourth quarter?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Sure. So first, on securities yield. So that did play a role, Marty.




 But more importantly, the impact on securities yields came from mix and just lower rates overall. So predominantly, mix and lower rates, and then to a lesser extent, your point on prepaid as well as a little bit of day counts. And then on betas, broadly speaking, we'd say betas are symmetric. And so if you look at the retail side, as I said before, very little movement on SEBI. And we did see rates paid even tick up a little bit there quarter on quarter. Wholesale, there's obviously more opportunity to reprice, but we do that client by client. And we're not going to lose valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And so what we saw there, as you might expect, in CIB, rates paid down quarter over quarter. And then we also saw rates pay down in both AWM and the commercial bank, but a little bit less so.Marlin Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- Analyst




 And then would you see retail improving next quarter? And then Jamie, I wanted to talk to you about liquidity. Two things: one, we saw the repo market. And as you looked at Volcker and the liquidity coverage ratios, you've kind of taken the big banks out of participating and being able to solve for some of those liquidity issues. So the Fed has kind of put a ring fence around this, putting that all on their shoulders versus letting JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs or Bank of America jump in and help in those processes. And then when you sold the loans this quarter, those mortgage loans, and replaced them with securities, was that related to liquidity or just the decisioning process on that?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So the loan decision is because we are at standardized capital now, which I think, by the way, risk -- I mean, the advance is far more important, and we should probably report more than that because that's 13%. But when we're constrained by standardized, there are points in time when putting mortgage on your balance sheet just gives you a very low return. And of course, you have a portfolio decision. You can sell it or put it in your balance sheet.




 If you sell it, you're going to probably reinvest in securities. So it's a pure economic calculation of what gives you a better return. And that's why, I think we need some fixes in the mortgage market about securitizations. Because I think we've pointed out, if you had built the securitizations, you have a healthy mortgage market, you keep some of them on your balance sheet. You sell some of the risk. And you wouldn't have to sell these mortgages per se. And I do think -- and the liquidity, we've focused on liquidity at the fed account. We have 400 -- probably total $450 billion of cash, T-bills, repo, deposit at the fed, and there's all -- a bunch of certain constraints. And you want to base a proper liquidity. But then I should also point out that those things go into getting multiple GSIB calculations, multiple other calculations. So you kind of calibrate, of course, all those things and optimize across all those things. But I do think you're correct. The banks are deploying now but they will not be able to redeploy a big chunk of that $500 billion that we have in all the markets when the time comes. It's not Volcker per se. Volcker is a slightly different thing.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter. We do think we'll continue to see deposit margin compression there on the retail side. We have come off the peaks in terms of CD pricing, but you still have slight migration there into interest-bearing products.OperatorOur next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jen, you had mentioned earlier just the point about that next year's earning asset growth will be led largely through deposits. But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the wealth management complex?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Look, I think it's difficult to know. I think, in a declining rate environment, as I said, I think the higher-yielding alternatives are obviously less attractive for consumers. We do still see good organic growth in wholesale as well in both treasury services and securities services.




 So I think it's difficult to know. The macro environment will be a big determinant.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Understood. And the second question, the card revenue margin you mentioned, it's kind of flattened out. And I'm just wondering, can you first walk us through the NII versus fee components there? Any -- is it partially because of that obvious NII challenge? Is there also any changes with regards to just the underlying card fee activity?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Yes. There is really just timing. There's just seasonality there. So at Investor Day, we said that the card revenue rate would be 11 50%, plus or minus. But fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, and so we still expect to hit that 11 50%, plus or minus, for the full-year guidance, so just seasonality.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And that's -- and the thing I'd add here, it doesn't have the same compression that it does in deposits.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Very different dynamic there.OperatorOur next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning. That's one to follow-up on. You talked about the fourth-quarter net interest come just under $14 billion, and that's not a bad place to start for next year. You highlighted balance sheet growth and mix and had some puts and takes. But it's probably not as bad as I think some would have thought. Think about that $14 billion-ish as potential run rate plus or minus. I'm just trying to better understand, like, what's the rate assumption that you have. And how much of a swing factor is the duration change that you did in the third quarter helping that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So I mean, we're doing that based on the latest implieds. And it's obviously early days. We're working through our budget process as we speak. So it's based on the latest implieds, which have a cut in October and a cut in April. And 10-year, call it, 1.70% plus or minus. So relative to where we might have been just a couple of months ago, or even weeks ago, it might have been a different outlook. So I think it's important to take it with a health warning that's on the latest implied because that is, of course, what we know.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And it's assuming some balance sheet growth, as opposed to all things being equal. That would be worse.




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right. It would be worse. The balance sheet growth, that will partial offset to larger impacts from just rates.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And what is the rate sensitivity at this point? And how is that split between the short and long end?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer There, I would just say you can look at the earnings at risk that we'll have in the Q. I mean, that's probably the best way to think about it. Because that is not an NII sensitivity, but is an interest rate sensitivity. And so that will be out in a few weeks.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.




Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for allowing my follow-up question. But Jamie, this is the first earnings call we had since the Business Roundtable came up with a new statement that it's not about shareholder-driven capitalism. It's about stakeholder-driven capitalism. And I was hanging out at the New Yorker Festival over the weekend and your name came up, and at least one author said he spoke to you. And the real question, what is the political and regulatory risk to JPMorgan to earnings as we look out over a year? You're having the presidential debates. Over the weekend, people talked about -- and the politicians talked about the wealth tax, the transaction tax, the change in corporate tax, personal tax, basically flattening the pyramid. And it seems like a lot of people point their fingers at the banks, including JPMorgan. So my question to you is what are you doing...




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer They're pointing their fingers as base on what? Point their fingers as a base for what?Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst I think part of the cause, part of the cause of inequality in America. Banks should be doing more to help out the situation. And again, it's a whole -- this is just one example, Mike. The way I saw this at the New Yorker Festival, this was kind of intellectual underpinnings of a lot of the policies that are being introduced today.




 And so you're seeing that in the politicians' statements about wealth tax, changes to the bank business model, too much deregulation. And it's just an environment -- I mean, here we are 10 years after the financial crisis, where I would summarize it as very anti-bank. And I know JPMorgan had proposals to help move the company and the country ahead. But how do you, as head of the Business Roundtable, help the industry and corporate America manage these concerns about income inequalities and these other topics that come up in the presidential debates. I know it's a big question. But hey, you're in that role as -- with the Business Roundtable.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. So the business roundtable, checking -- get rid of shareholder value, basically said shareholder value and customers and employees and communities, which essentially has been how many of these banks have been running for years. I think part of the statement was a lot of the world looked at shareholder value and it -- that you have rapacious profit seeking. Whereas most CEOs are thinking pretty long term, building people, taking care of their employees, their customers.




 And we can highlight all the great things we do for employees: huge training, health, wellness, retirement, sharing the wealth inside the company. And we do, do all that. And most of these companies do that. A lot of these larger companies, they're great community citizens when it comes to trying to participate and help and stuff like that. So I do think -- and so as a JPMorgan matter, we're going to grow our businesses and serve our clients as best we can whatever the environment is. That environment changes. Politically, it changes. Economically it changes, geopolitically. But we're just going to navigate to do the best we can, serving our clients the best we can. And I do think that we try -- and I'm speaking for a lot of -- to try to do a tremendous amount to help the communities because there have been people left behind. The inner city schools are not failing because of banks. OK? And infrastructure is not failing because of banks. So I think we can help build infrastructure, help train people, get more skills, get involved with education systems and like all the kind of stuff that a lot of us all do in Detroit, we could lift up society. And I think it's good for us to lift up society. And when society does better, everyone does better. If you don't believe me, look at Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, North Korea, etc., that doing well is a good thing for society, and we can share the wealth a little bit.




 So I'm not able to respond to specific political statements out there, but we'll do our part to be a great community citizen and serve our shareholders at the same time.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst So can I put words in your mouth? I mean doing well for communities and employees and all the other stakeholders is good for the shareholders long term. Is that...Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Yes. And Mike, I actually gave examples in the crisis about the amount of people that we financed at markets way -- at prices way below the market. We're doing that to make rapacious profit seeking? No. And that included states, cities, hospitals, businesses, consumers, etc. And so you won't be -- our answer was no, we're going to help our clients get through this tough time. It wasn't about our profitability. Our profitability dropped dramatically, and we were fine. And I think that was long term, but you can never get sued over that. So -- and same time we do with employees. We're constantly investing in employees and branches, in jobs and training. That stuff will benefit three years out, five years out, 10 years out, 20 years out.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst




 All right. Thank you.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah.Operator




Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Quick question on equity trading. I know you gave an update on where you thought the revenues would come in, in mid-September. Looks like it came in worse than what you were looking for. Is there a way to kind of break out what was the impact of the potential marks on investments versus true equity trading revenues?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. In equity derivatives, it was a combination of weaker client activity and some losses on inventory, but it wasn't meaningful. Those losses were certainly not meaningful in the grand scheme of things, but they were part of the equity derivatives story.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst But there wasn't any other additional investments in there that had marks on them impacting the numbers?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer No.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst OK. And then separately on CECL. I know you've been doing parallel runs, as all banks have been. Are you at the point now where you can kind of give what the pro forma provision will be for CECL? Or do you plan on doing that prior to the adoption date?




Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Well, as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion. We've done a ton of work, as you say, and a lot of modeling. The range is still between $4 billion and $6 billion. And we'll be able to be more precise, obviously, as we prepare for the January 1 implementation.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. A follow-up on the equity. I mean I know DB books were in the market, and I believe that you were a winner of some of that. Is that in these numbers in 3Q or that comes in, in 4Q?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 That was in prime balance I think you're referring to. I don't know the answer to that.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer It was not meaningful whatever it is.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 OK. All right. And then separately, there's been some news obviously on discount brokers cutting commissions to zero. I know you have You Invest and that that's a recent launch. But how do you think about how that impacts your business model? Is that just something that you would consider is specific to You Invest? Or do you think that that's something that would have a bigger impact and potentially more optionality for your clients across your wealth spectrum?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So majority of our customers in You Invest already trade for free, and so we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. As we think about You Invest, it is one component of our broader investment strategy. And as I said, we're really proud of this quarter's results with client investment assets being up 13%. It was an important product launch for us in terms of meeting an unmet need with our existing customers, but we're pleased to see the market moving toward us.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.69%)Q2 2019 Earnings CallJul 16, 2019, 8:30 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second-quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to thank Marianne for nearly seven years as CFO and for her support of me over many years, but particularly for support during my transition into this role. So a huge thanks to Marianne.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I just want to add my thanks, too. I think Marianne, as you all know, did a great job. Smart, honest, thoughtful, helped make the company a better company. So all the thanks goes to Marianne, and we also all know that Jenny will do a great job, too.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Thank you, James. OK.  So now onto the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.  Starting on Page 1, the firm reported record net income of $9.7 billion and EPS of $2.82 on revenue of 29.6 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Included in these results are tax benefits of $768 million related to the resolution of a number of tax audits. Adjusting for this as well as a few other notable items that largely offset, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter.  Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding;  No. 1 in global IBCs year to date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion, while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.  Overall, for the firm, total loan growth was 2% year on year, but down 1% sequentially. Important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm. Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage.  Now on to Page 2 and some more detail about our second-quarter results. Revenue of $29.6 billion was up 1.2 billion or 4% year on year as net interest income was up approximately 900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher rates. And noninterest revenue was up approximately 300 million year on year, largely driven by the absence of the card rewards liability adjustment results in the prior year.  Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, noninterest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IB fees as previously guided.  Expenses of 16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately 250 million. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of 1.1 billion, down 5% year on year.  In consumer, credit costs of 1.1 billion were flat, but higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases. And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters. Once again, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale.  Now on to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, up more than 10 basis points versus last quarter. In the quarter, the firm distributed 7.5 billion of capital to shareholders, and as you know, the Fed did not adjust to our 2019 CCAR capital plan. We are pleased to have significant flexibility with gross repurchase capacity of up to 29.4 billion over the next four quarters and the board announced its intention to increase the common dividend to $0.90 per share, effective in the third quarter.  Now on to Page 4 in consumer and community banking. CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%.




 Loans were down slightly year on year driven by home lending down 7% reflecting the loan sale I just mentioned. However, card loan growth was healthy, up 8%. Business banking loans were up 2% and auto loans and leases were flat.  We saw strong deposit and investment growth year on year, with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 16%, growing across both cyclical and digital channel. Card sales were up 11% as growth remained strong across key products. And across the franchise, active mobile users were up 12% year on year given continued engagement and our new features. For example, customers had opened over 2 million checking and savings accounts digitally, activated over 60 million Chase offers and our enrollment in credit journey now exceeds 18 million.  Revenue of 13.8 billion was up 11%. This increase included two notable items that largely offset. First, the current quarter includes a negative MSR adjustment in home lending, driven by updates to our model inputs and in the prior year, as I mentioned, we had a rewards liability adjustment in cards of approximately 330 million.  Consumer and business banking was up 11% on higher deposit NII, driven by margin expansion. Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.  In cards, merchant services and auto was up 18%. Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes.  Expenses of 7.2 billion were up 4%, driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. Of note, the overhead ratio was 52% and we delivered significant positive operating leverage.  On credit, this quarter included a reserve release in the home lending purchase credit-impaired portfolio of $400 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in cards of 200 million. This is primarily driven by growth, and to a lesser extent mix as the newer vintages naturally seasoning and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were up 212 million. Excluding the recovery on a loan sale in home lending in the prior year, net charge-offs were up 80 million driven by card as we continue to grow the portfolio.  Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 5. CIB reported net income of 2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of 9.6 billion. As a reminder, our performance was particularly strong last year, which featured record or near-record revenues in overall IB fees and equity markets.




 With that in mind, for the quarter IB revenue of 1.8 billion was down 9% year on year in a market that was also down.  Advisory, debt underwritings and equity underwriting fees were down 15%, 13% and 11%, respectively, reflecting lower levels of deal activity as well as a 10-year record share in equity underwriting in the prior year. It's worth noting on a year-to-date basis, we continue to rank No. 1 overall and have gained share across all products and regions, benefiting from our continued investments in bankers.  In advisory, we grew share in announced deal volumes and announced more deals than any other bank. In debt underwriting, we also ranked No. 1, benefiting from our strong lead-left position in leveraged finance, and in equity underwriting, we have seen significant pickup in activity since the first quarter and we continue to benefit from our leadership positions in tech and healthcare where there has been some robust activity.  Looking forward, the overall IB pipeline is healthy, though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year and with fewer acquisition financing and refinancing opportunity with our underwriting. Dialogue with clients remains active and we expect strong deal flow to continue.  Moving to markets. Total revenue was 5.4 billion, which was flat year on year. Our results include a notable gain in fixed income from the IPO of Tradeweb. Excluding this gain, markets' revenue would have been down 6% year on year against a strong second-quarter performance last year.  Fixed income markets was down 3% on an adjusted basis, with relative weakness in EMEA, partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment.  Equity markets was down 12% against a record second quarter last year, but due to client activity and a tough compare contributed to a year-on-year decline in equities derivatives. That said, cash and primes remained stable with client balances in prime reaching an all-time high.  Treasury services and securities services revenues were 1.1 billion and 1 billion, down 4% and 5% year on year, respectively, with organic growth being more than offset by deposit margin compression. As a reminder, similar to last quarter, deposit margin was primarily impacted by the funding basis compression rather than client betas, and at the firmwide level, there is an offset.  Sequentially, treasury services was flat and securities services was up 3% on higher balances and fees.  Finally, expenses of 5 and a half billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. And the comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 28%.  Now moving on to commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of 2.2 billion was down 5% year on year, predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances. Also worth noting here, Gross IB revenue of 1.4 billion was up 8% year to date on strong syndicated lending and M&A advisory activity and we continue to address slowly toward our long-term $3 billion target.  Deposit balances was down 1% year on year, and importantly, up 1% sequentially as balances have largely stabilized in total, although we continue to see migration from noninterest to interest-bearing deposits. Expenses of 864 million were up 2% year on year, driven by ongoing investments in banker coverage and technology.  Loans were up 1% and C&I loans being flat or up 3% adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio.




 The story here remains unchanged. We saw solid growth in areas where we've been investing, including expansion market with specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activity.  CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective given where we are in the cycle.  Finally, credit costs were 29 million with a net charge-off rate of 3 basis points.  Now onto asset and wealth management on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $719 million, with pre-tax margin and ROE of 27%. Revenue of 3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as the impact of higher average market levels was offset by lower investment valuation gains.  Expenses of 2.6 billion were up 1% year on year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees. For the quarter, we saw record net long-term inflows of 36 billion driven by fixed income and we had net liquidity inflows of 4 billion.  AUM of 2.2 trillion and overall client assets of 3 trillion, both records, were up 7%, driven by cumulative net inflows into long term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels globally.  Deposits were up 2% sequentially and up 1% year on year and similar to the commercial bank, balances in total have largely stabilized. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 7% with strength in both Wholesale and mortgage lending.  Now onto corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of 828 million, including the vast majority of the tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. Revenue was 322 million, up 242 million year on year due to higher net interest income, driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year. And expenses of 232 million were down 47 million year on year. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. On this page, I'll just comment on NII, which should not be surprising given the changes to the rate environment. As you can see, we're updating our 2019 full-year NII outlook to about 57 and a half billion. The reduction is based on multiple scenarios, which assumes, among other things, lower long-end rates and up to three rate cuts this year, which is consistent with current market sentiment. And as a reminder, this compares to a rate scenario that has seen zero cuts at the time of first-quarter earnings.  So to wrap up, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Overall, credit is in great shape, and the earning power of the company is evident.




 We delivered strong returns this quarter and the diversification and scale of our business model positions us well to outperform in any environment. Understanding there is some macro uncertainty and potential headwinds from the rate outlook, we still expect to grow the franchise and we'll continue to strategically invest in our businesses in technology, bankers and beyond.  And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst




 Hey, good morning. I noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter. I just wanted to get a sense as to what you feel is driving that uptick. And do you think how sustainable is it, 8% year-over-year growth?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So on current loan growth, we feel very good about what we're seeing there. As we talked about at investor day, we have a real opportunity with our existing customers. And we talked about how our existing customers have about 250 billion of borrowing off us, about 100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback. So you can think of this as highly targeted to high-quality existing customers, and for the first time, we're actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers. And so we're really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day.




Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst All right. Should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So on the mortgage business, I would say, it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously highly rate dependent. But I would say the structural challenges in that business remain unchanged. And so we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity. And so looking at loan sales and thinking about derisking the portfolio from a servicing perspective.




 So good quarter on the back of the rally, but it doesn't change the overall structural challenges.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst OK, thanks.Operator




Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Hi, so I just wanted to go back to what you were saying earlier in that your guide or your guide lower is including up to three rate cuts this year, which would suggest to me that your net interest income is quite defensive in the face of rate cuts. I guess my first question is, could you give us your primary assumption for that $500 million swing, particularly on deposit pricing?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 OK, sure. So first of all, I'll take you back to the first quarter where our guidance was 58 billion-plus and we talked about some pressure on the long end at that point. That pressure has persisted and in fact increased, and so we pulled the impact of the long end through in terms of our outlook. And then on the short end, the range of outcomes are obviously quite broad, and so we thought about a range of outcomes of one to three rate cuts. And so you can think about if it's one cut, 57 and a half billion-plus, and if it's more, 57 and a half billion-minus. And then based on current advice, you can think about the third quarter being 100  to 150 million below the second quarter and then a bit more than that in the fourth quarter given we would have a full quarter at that point.  Oh, and then in terms of betas, I mean largely speaking, you can think of betas as being symmetric, and so on the consumer side, we saw little reprice on the way up, and so there is not a lot of opportunity on the way down. On the wholesale side, if you look at large institutional businesses, like treasury services and securities services, we are largely at full reprice there, and so there should be opportunity there. And then in places like the commercial bank and asset and wealth management, we are still ahead of what the model would have assumed, but we have started to see reprice tick up there. But importantly, I would say, we're not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we'll see how it goes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 It's all embedded with your assumption.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And it's all embedded in --Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst




 Got it. And just going back to Jim's question, I noticed that investment securities balances continue to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5%. Should we think about this as part of the overall, you're saying optimizing capital and liquidity, and therefore, as we think about it going forward, we could also expect to see perhaps some release in RWA growth and some release in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So on the RWA side, yes, that is precisely why we are doing it, and so when you see the loan sales in home lending, yes they are offset in securities purchases, which are more efficient from a capital perspective as well as a liquidity perspective. So, yes. Having said that, on reserves, I mean reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that because of course that will depend on the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 And I would just say that our standardized capital ratio is a 12.2%, advanced is 13%. Advanced is obviously a far more important relevant economic number. It simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and can't securitize.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got It. Thank You. Operator




Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So the efficiency ratio went from 56 to 55% year over year, and I guess that's with some accelerated tech spending. So do you plan to keep this pace of tech spending going? And what's the current update on that tech spending? Where is it connecting? Where is it not connecting because I think you said it accelerated for a couple of years and maybe we'd see more results in 2020, 2021?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 Can I just take that one? So it's about 11 and half billion dollars today. I think it was a little bit lower last year. If we had to say where it is today, for next year it would be something like 11 and a half, and I think it's becoming more efficient. When you're having tech, it's something that's becoming cheaper all the time, and then you're also investing money all the time, which we're going to do regardless of the environment. So we're not going to cut things we're trying to build like my rewards programs and change my loan and the credit journey because there is a resumption to something like this. So Daniel and Gordon will tell you right now that they think they get more efficient spend and that we shouldn't -- but we will -- you have to spend to win in this business. And we're very efficient which is very core to how we spend in technology. We're going to do it regardless of the environment, and we'll try to get more efficient in tech spend, too.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest and we've talked a lot about AI, machine learning. It's early innings there and there is a lot that we're going to be able to do assuming that's there and become more productive and then cloud -- developers can become more productive using the cloud.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, it's amazing, our forward costs with all the things around the world today are down because of techniques with AI and big data and stuff like that. And so it's hardly about you invest. You look at our client investment asset grew 16%, portion of it is you invest, and obviously, You Invest requires hundreds of millions of dollars to build. So you've got to put all these things in perspective about how you try and make the decisions going forward.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst And then follow-up, Jamie, you mentioned the environment, all the things taking place in the world, how is the environment now? I mean on the one hand, you have trade war, you have lower interest rates, your capital markets which are down for the big banks, you have a lot of pessimism. On the other hand, you highlighted your results. What's -- when you take the temperature of the environment, what's the temperature?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's not that bad. Uncertainty is a constant, but one thing in life, as you know, is going to be uncertain going forward. And geopolitical tension is kind of a constant. Those things may be a little bit higher now than normal. But we -- I think what we see is global growth is north of 3%. You're kind of expecting, I think, it would be 2 and a half percent this year. The consumer in the United States is doing fine. Business sentiment is a little bit worse, mostly probably driven by the trade war. And if you travel around the world, you know that Japan is growing and Europe is growing a little bit and Brazil has got to negative four and zero. A lot of countries have opportunity to expand. They are doing great, but they should be doing better over the next 20, 30. So I wouldn't get too pessimistic.




 Obviously, the Fed will react to -- with the database, they always say it's more important at this point on than just what the Fed does. If the Fed is cutting rates and we're going into recession, that's not a good rate cut. If the Fed actually raises rates one day because we're booming, that's not so bad.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst All Right. Thank you. Operator




Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi, thanks. I'm not sure if I missed it, but I think total average loans were up 2% year on year, but that was impacted by the loan sales. Can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year on year without that?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So yes, there's a few things going on in loan growth, as you say it, Glenn. So we have the loan sales, we also have the runoff of the tax-exempt portfolio. So you can think about loan growth probably closer to 4% if you adjust for those items, and importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that we're seeing in terms of the areas where we're investing. And then -- and for the full year, you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex CIB of 2 to 3% full year.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK, appreciate that. And then just curious on the noninterest-bearing deposits only being down 2% year on year, we've seen a lot bigger numbers of some peers. Is that just strength of JPMorgan franchise? Or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 So as I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and AWM. We are still seeing some migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, but largely we're seeing those balances stabilize. And then we do, of course, have continued growth in the consumer bank. And the second quarter is typically seasonally high in the consumer bank. So we have some growth in noninterest-bearing there. And even in the consumer bank, where we've seen growth decelerate, that's largely as a result of consumer spending. So that feels healthy as well.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK. Maybe last one on -- appreciate the guide on 2019. Because it's a half, if you look forward into 2020 with no incremental rate cuts, is it remotely linear? In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate in current environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion, or is it way too complex to oversimplify like that?




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's probably more complicated, Glenn. And so just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are and, importantly, if we're looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about. So we're not going to give further guidance on the 2020 until we know more.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst OK, thank you. Appreciate it.




OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning. When you take a look at your merchant services business, you had some really strong growth year over year. I think it was up 12%.




 And then your card volumes, excluding the commercial card, were also up very strong. Can you share with us what's driven that strong growth, that double-digit rate of growth?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks for noticing.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 I would say that is firing on all cylinders. So it's brand, it's people, it's products. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy U.S. consumer as well and, in fact, retail sales this morning looked strong. So we can expect that to continue.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Is it more the market -- as you just referenced the retail sales, they were strong, is it more that or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost?




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, we have taken share in -- a little bit of share in card. As you know, we're No. 1 in sales there. I think, importantly, what's helpful in card is that we don't even need to take share to grow just given the secular tailwind that we have in the card business on the electronification of cash.  And we're taking share in merchant environment.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We expect to do -- take more share in the future.




Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Speaking of the future, can you guys give us some color on what your first read of Libra is, that the Facebook announcement about the process of -- payments system that they're going to initiate?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So just to put it in perspective, Gerard, we've been talking about blockchain for seven years and very little has happened and we then turned to Libra three years ago. So I wouldn't spend too much time on it. We don't mind competition, and the request has always been the same.




 The governments are -- we want level-playing field, and governments further insist that people who hold money or move money, all the liquidity in the world where they have right amount of controls in place, no one wants to aid, in fact, terrorism or criminal activities and that can be true for everybody involved in this, not only basically doing either KYC, BSA for a long period of time and those fears I think would just become for everybody at one point, and they should.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Operator




Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi. I wanted to ask about the CCAR and you've got a big authorization this year. How did you approach the CCAR plan this year in relation to your long-term CET1 target of 11 and 12 that you talked about?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer




 Sure. So as we think about capital distribution first, we would start by always saying that we prefer to use our capital to invest and grow our businesses and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then to return excess capital to our shareholders. And so we are pleased with the approval and the additional capacity to return that 29.4 billion to shareholders. Having said that, we are still targeting the upper end of the 11 to 12% range. We're always going to want to have a management buffer because, as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses and then, of course, there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework. And then importantly, we wouldn't actually need to make that decision for a few more quarters, given the way the capital distribution plan is laid out over four quarters. But as of now, we are still targeting the upper ends of 11 to 12%.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst OK. Thanks, Jen. And any updated thoughts on CECL? Or could you remind us what your thoughts on initial impact there?




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So it hasn't changed from investor day. Our range continues to be 4  to 6 billion. And we're prepared for the January 1 implementation.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer This is Jim. So CCAR is one test a year on stress. We do 120 a week, and so we are always prepared for stress. CCAR has us losing 20  or 30 billion over nine consecutive quarters.




 I just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after Lehman, the real stress event, we made 20 to $30 billion. And CCAR assumes you're going to grow your balance sheet, it assumes you're going to continue with dividends and stuff like that. We have plenty of capital. I mean our capital cup run it over, and we deployed that capital. And remember, the thing in every branch is for every branch, you tend to use $10 million of capital. So 400 branches of that should be $4 billion in capital. So it restrains on growth, also restrains on capital usage and ability to finance the U.S. economy. So we're really optimistic about our ability to somehow use our capital, including our InstaMed acquisition we just did, which I think closes sometime soon.Operator




Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Jamie, you mentioned about blockchain. We've been hearing about it for seven years and not much has happened. But I think you at JPM have built a blockchain solution for at least your correspondent banks. And I guess I wanted to understand where you think you're planning on taking that right now, just AML and KYC use case. But is that something that you think you could deliver more functionality over time?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, we think the blockchain is real, but the reason it takes so long is that people have to agree with protocol, people write a lot of codes to get into it. But the one you're referring to IAN, which is information network of banks. So right now banks transfer a lot of information among each other, think of trade finance and correspondent bank and stuff like that. So I think we have like 120 banks signed up. We're going to have -- so right now, it's for bank wholesale use needing information. You'll all have the same information. You can move things. But eventually, you're going to move money quicker with data. So yes, we're optimistic about that, and we're going to roll it out as soon as we can and constantly test it to make sure it's secured and all that. I remind people, when it comes to moving money, JPMorgan Chase moves $6 trillion a day quite securely and quite cheaply. You want to look at the problem you're trying to solve, but people would generally say, well, we didn't have real-time payments that were true. And now we do effectively sell for P2P, and now we do effectively [Inaudible] real-time payments in TCH.




 So we are building the things that the future is going to want, APIs, blockchain ledgers that have much more data, a real-time movement of money that also goes through floor checks, etc. So we're quite optimistic about it. It will just take a while to get everyone using it. One day it will have to be opened up to a broader customer set possibly.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst So one of the things that's coming out in these senate and house financial services banking committee meetings is this desire for real-time payments, desire for a cheaper solution for payments. And that's supposedly what Libra was going to offer, but to your point, it seems like you're already doing that. The question is, how do we think about the outlook for interchange? And is there -- what's your strategy toward interchange pricing here as we go over this period?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




 This is a race. There is real-time P2P free, safe and secure sell. So when people say, really, that's not cross-border. So there are people who might want to do that cross-border. Remember, cross-border meant much, much more than actual use of debit card, credit card payment systems here. And we've obviously built a real-time payment solution. It's actually already in use. And to me, the issue there is to diminish fraud. You have to make sure that real-time payments is also put through effectively real-time code checks and stuff like that. So in the United States, credit cards, debit cards, these are people who love these cards. The beneficiaries are consumer. You guys remember that's why we're here to serve. And someone is going to pay eventually for services provided, but people like their credit cards. They use their credit cards more than they use their debit cards. Maybe I don't remember that's why you mentioned debit cards.




Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah, when you get rewarded, that's great.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And JPMorgan, now you're getting more free stuff. You get free -- you can buy and sell stock for free. We just gave you a very good -- we just got rolled out here in a few accounts, but global investing, very cheap, very clear. So we're going to take and give our clients more and better advancement cheaper all the time, and now we package that with Sapphire Banking or Sapphire card or discounts and mortgages that are not always made to be seen, but the future is very bright because if we can do more for our customers, that's a very good thing.




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And don't forget, on credit cards, you get charge-back rights and you get flows.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right. And you get -- if you go online and you're a Chase customer, you get your FICO score for free. You're going to be able to -- you got to tell customers the great potential how they can improve their FICO score. You get offers like the Chase [Inaudible].




 I mean, you don't really market, but it's really taken off.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So the Chase offers, we talked about that at investor day. It's like a really powerful flywheel where we can -- we can deliver value to our large merchant clients in terms of being able to bring a very large customer base to them and then we can deliver that value to our customers at zero cost to us. And so as I said in the presentation, we've had over 60 million Chase offers activated and so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers, but our large merchant clients at zero cost to us.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 So a message of more efficient, less cost maybe needs to get heard on the hill as well.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, and we talked about it a lot of time and a lot of people understand that, and of course we always want to do a better job for our consumers, which we have been referring.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst




 Yeah. I guess the final question here is just on the under-banked. Is there something or is there an offer that you have for them or are you considering that because that I'm just thinking about where fintech is trying to exploit you and I know it's a catchphrase under-banked that is being used by Libra, it doesn't necessarily to me seem like it's solving anything for them, but maybe you've got a better solution that we just don't focus on.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, so we have --  some of the stream in Chase we have 25% of branches around my neighborhoods. When we go to those neighborhoods, we do some plans. We're doing more and more financial education, I think this is really important. I just mentioned the FICO score, but maybe there might be other things we can do, we do Chase chats to get people into the branch, educate them about saving, FICO scores. We think we can do this to get a mortgage or buy a house and stuff like that. And then we have a product, which really is great called secure banking and think of it as a card where it's the full thing. You can overdraft, I think it's 4.95 a month. You can use ATM, you can have direct deposit, you can do online mobile payments and stuff like that.




 So we think it's a great product for the under-banked and I think that's going to have 25% and we'll kind of push that a little bit more. So we always [Inaudible]. And then we also have special, I call it venture banking, the entrepreneur color fund. We're making loans to entrepreneurs of color which are not traditional bank loans but help you grow your businesses. So we find a lot of ways to do it and really a lot of [Inaudible], I wish they were at the forefront of that.  Fintech, of course, all these firms are trying to eat your lunch. And I think that's good. It's called American capitalism. And we have to stay on our toes to compete. But we are, like Jim had said cards which we rolled out last year -- announced last year, change my plan and change my loan so that people can view their credit balance immediately to do what they want to do and do it well. We rolled out Zelle P2P that's good for everybody. So if you have a bank account, you can move money to your friends and relatives rather than pay the $10 money changer fees and stuff like that. So we're already trying to do a better job for American consumers. We think we'll do a great job for them and when they do have complaints, we'll fix it.




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right. And you mentioned the 25% in [Inaudible]  In terms of our branch footprint. In our expansion market, that's 30%.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks .




OperatorOur next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks a lot. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the balance sheet, last year so you've seen a huge jump in the trading-related assets and I know you had the accounting changed, as you mentioned in the supplement, but could you talk about, is that related to market share gains, is it related to just specific strategies with regard to managing liquidity and it doesn't seem to be equally growing on the asset side in the trading liability. So just can you explain the dynamics behind that and how that adds to your net interest income story?




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet growth that you saw quarter over quarter, that was primarily related to our balance sheet and tens of businesses in markets businesses. And then we were down on a spot basis quarter-over-quarter. But we start with deposit growth, and so we have had strong deposit growth, and so you see that reflected on the balance sheet side as well as you would have seen securities balances as well and some of that is adding duration and some of that is short-duration securities that are higher yielding than IOER, and yes.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. So it is part of the liquidity management strategy. OK. And Jen, did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter?




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just if you get a higher return on REIT body, you get IOER, you're going to do that. If you get a higher return using standardized capital on securities or on home loans, you're going to do that, and that's what we're seeing in some of these banks.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right. The Street, I should have mentioned, do the home sales and home lending.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Right. OK, got it. That makes sense. And did you say -- can you tell us what the amount of the gains on the loan sales this quarter were if they were above trend?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer We haven't disclosed the amounts of the gains, and we had some loan sales in the fourth quarter, the first quarter and the second quarter. The first and second quarter in terms of the notional amount, the first quarter was about 7 billion and the second quarter was about 9 billion, so just a little bit more.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Beginning of the second quarter is that net. It showed up in different places, but not material.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, yeah.




Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. And lastly, just any thoughts on the investment banking pipeline and just continuation of the outlook across the buckets there of banks?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So in terms of the investment banking pipeline, I'll just remind you that the third quarter is typically a seasonally lower quarter, and so sequentially you should think about IB fees being down a bit. That said, the pipeline is healthy, although off a record performance last year, which is assumption of a resurgent to more normal levels of activity as well as some overhang from macro uncertainty. In M&A, still feels very healthy and it's still a stage where company are looking for synergistic opportunities for growth, especially in North America and perhaps Europe a bit more muted.




 ECM, we had a very strong second quarter. So that will taper off in the second half a bit. But I would say deals are getting done well in the current environment. And then DCM, DCM will be more subdued reflecting a slowdown in acquisition financing activity as well as refinancing opportunities, but albeit with a good backdrop for new issuance given the rate environment.OperatorOur next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst




 Good morning. So I realize rate expectations can change quickly, but how do you think about managing the company in a rate environment that follows the curve that's out there for three to four cuts. And you said earlier, you would have cut back on technology, but are other areas in expenses, you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So in terms of balance sheet management, we manage the balance sheet in both directions. It's a negatively convexed balance sheet, and so all else being equal, as rates are declining, we would naturally drift shorter driven both by assets and liabilities. So you would expect us to add duration, which we did this quarter. But we're not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment. We're going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration. And then in terms of expenses, again, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of interest rate environment. And I'll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here, and so if we end up with insurance cuts, it's a temporary headwind, and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about, but as Jamie always says, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of the macro environment.




 That said, in a broader slowdown, obviously there are natural levers on our volume-related expenses and we redecision a large part of our investment portfolio on an annual basis. We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity depending upon the opportunity to take a look at that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Remember, in a real recession, there are always opportunities to reduce your costs and vendors pull all those themselves, they will give you better deals and stuff like that. There are also huge opportunities to spending money wisely. Our Sapphire card was birthed in '09, and you could imagine that this healthy growth might be a great opportunity, but we're not going to take it. And so I think you got to be very careful. Related to marketing money, you need better spends in a downturn, the returns on it immediately double.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst And you talked about the capital and your thought process there. Obviously, the authorization of the buybacks is a very big number. Is it your expectations that you will use it all or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth, stock price and the environment?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I would say still to be determined. Our first choice will always be to use our excess capital to invest and grow our business, so it's still to be determined. And as you know it's over four quarters, and so we have time to think about it, but obviously, we have the flexibility.




Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Is the timing of that even, or is there a flexibility there, too?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It has been in the past, but we can change that every day.




OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Hey, good morning. A couple of questions. First on the NII outlook beyond this year and I fully appreciate you're not giving guidance beyond this year. But you do have the guidance from investor day out there of a sustainable NII of 58 to 60 billion that was set in a very, very different rate environment.




 If we were to see multiple rate cuts, how do we think about that guidance and how -- I mean what are some of the moving parts that might get you perhaps to the lower end of that 58  to 60 billion? Is it simply dependent on how the economy responds, deposit pricing, if you can just kind of outline what you think some of those moving parts are?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So the guidance we gave at investor day steady-state 58 to 60, I would say, largely still stands. Importantly, because when we talked about that at investor day, we weren't assuming any further benefit from rate. So we were assuming that any incremental increases in rates would be offset and repriced, and so the majority of that growth was going to come from balance sheet growth and mix. And if you remember the slides, there were a number of arrows on the slide. Even at that time, which was obviously a different rate environment, we were implying that there were a number of different paths to get there. And so that obviously continues to be true. And so there may be a different path to get there and may take a little bit longer, but we still believe in that steady-state number because we still believe in the growth of the franchise.




Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst OK. OK. That's helpful. If I can change gears a little bit, you recently announced that you're closing Finn or you closed Finn, and I think the stated logic is you learned that millennials don't need a separate brand or experience, but can you just elaborate on the logic there? And what you learned from that experience because it does seem to maybe fly in the face of what some other entities or what financial institutions are doing with their digital banking strategy?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Go ahead, Jen.




Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I was just going to say we learned a lot in Finn, that we learned the importance of power to change brands. It certainly means that we don't need a separate brand. We also learned about a number of features that our customers love and we were able to reuse those features and port them over to the Chase mobile app. And so I think we always need to be testing and learning and doing things like this and not afraid to shut them down when we've learned what we needed to learn and can serve our customers through the primary Chase mobile app.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We've learned a lot how to do digital account openings only digital because we do have a retail banking center, the line that you already have, so a lot of other things there. We're always going to be learning some kind of skunkworks and learning from things like that. And so we don't look at those kind of things like failures at all. That is how you learn.




 And Jeff Bezos will tell you,  mistakes are good. Mistakes are what make you smarter and better. And so I hope we make some really good mistakes that can teach us all of our businesses at one point. The people doing Finn did a great job, they're embedded. And by the way, you can open a Chase account now and never go into a branch, and you could open an account or take up an account, it takes minutes to open an account. So we've got much better at digital only, but we got it separated from the physical branch system.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we'll be doing in small business and merchant processing and all these various things.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Got It. Thanks very much.




OperatorOur next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar.Eric Compton -- Morningstar -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So this question kind of ties into some of the items already mentioned, longer-term kind of tech-focused and also related to Finn. So there has been some press recently about reasons for closing down the Finn app and one of the items I was mentioned was some of the difficulties banks can potentially run into with their legacy platforms, which, for the most part, are built on COBOL, which has been around since the 60s and depending on who you talk up to, these legacy platforms can either be like huge problems for banks or not really a big deal.




 So I guess from the outside, at least for me, it can be kind of hard to tell what really is going on there. So my question is, as you compete with fintech firms who are building new platforms from scratch, how do you strategically view dealing with your own legacy platforms? Is there a need to kind of redo these things eventually in order to actually compete with newer tech over time? Do these legacy platforms really hamstring you in any way? Or is the hype around those issues really overdone? And if so, why? Thanks.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The hype has been around now for the better part of the decade, right? And we seem to be doing fine, but it is true -- and some of these legacy platforms is also the reason why we have 50 million customers. But it is true that over time, these platforms would be reformulated and refactored to be cloud eligible and things like that. And those things are more efficient. So your costs will go down, your error rates will go down. So the way I look at it a little bit is we run like 6,000 or 7,000 applications. Over time, those will be modularized and being refactored to be cloud eligible, either by private cloud or a public cloud. And yes, they will be more efficient. We also have tons of new digital platforms, AI built around these things that do the customer service outside that they see.




 They go over accounts in minutes. It is a frequent journey that we can modify so many things in days and weeks as opposed to years because you're not muddled with the old legacy system. And so it's a little bit of both. But those numbers are embedded in our tech spend. The refact rate, embedded data centers are getting better in AI, all these things are in those numbers.OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.




Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, thank you very much. Jen you did a great job. Look forward to all of you in a quarter. Thank you.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, James.

Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.
Starting on Page 1, the firm reported record net income of $9.2 billion, an EPS of $2.65 on record revenue of nearly $30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. The results this quarter were strong and broad-based. Highlights include core loan growth ex-CIB of 5% with loan trends continuing to progress as expected. Credit performance remained strong across businesses. We saw record client investment assets in Consumer of over $300 billion and record new money flows this quarter, and double-digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes, up 10% and 13% respectively. (inaudible) number one in Global IB fees and gained meaningful share with share well above 9% this quarter. In the Commercial Bank, we had record gross IB revenue. In Asset & Wealth Management record AUM and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage.
Turning to Page 2 and talking into more detail about the first quarter. Revenue of $29.9 billion was up $1.3 billion or 5% year-on-year, driven by net interest income, which was up $1.1 billion or 8% on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix. Non-interest revenue was up slightly as reported. But excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year, NII would have been up 5%, reflecting auto lease growth and strong Investment Banking fees. And while markets revenue was lower, there were other items more than offsetting.
Expense of $16.4 billion was up 2% relating to continued investments we're making in technology, real estate, marketing and front office, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of a little over $200 million. Credit remains favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $330 million year-on-year, driven by changes in Wholesale reserves.





In Consumer, charge-offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserve this quarter. In Wholesale, we had about $180 million of credit costs driven by reserve builds on select C&I client downgrades, and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy. Once again, these downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names and across sectors. Net reserve builds to this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolios, and we are not seeing signs of deterioration.
Moving on to Page 3 and balance sheet and capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.1%, up modestly from last quarter, with the benefit of strong earnings and AOCI gains, given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk-weighted assets. RWA is up primarily due to higher counterparty credit on trading activity, but most of these this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis.
Quarter-on-quarter loans were down in Home Lending as a result of a loan sale transaction and the CIB as a result of the large syndication and in Card and Asset Wealth Management seasonally. Also on the page, total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, principally driven by higher CIB trading assets, in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions.
Lower end-of-period loans are partially offset by treasury balances, including higher securities. In the quarter, the firm distributed $7.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $4.7 billion of share repurchases (inaudible) we submitted our 2019 CCAR capital plans to the Federal Reserve.





Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30% with consumers remaining strong and confident. Core loans were up 4% here year-on-year, driven by Home Lending and Cards both up 6% and Business Banking up 3%. Deposits grew 3%, in line with our expectations, and we believe we continue to outperform. Client investment assets were up 13%, driven by record new money flows, reflecting growth across physical and digital channels, including You Invest. We also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets.
Revenue of $13.8 billion was up 9%. Consumer & Business Banking revenue up 15% on higher deposit NII, driven by continued margin expansion. Home Lending revenue was down 11%, driven by net servicing revenue on both lower operating revenue and MSR. But notably while volumes are down, production revenue is up nicely year-on-year on disciplined pricing. And Cards, Merchant Services and Auto revenues was up 9%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes.
Expense of $7.2 billion was up 4%, driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation, partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On credit, net charge-offs were flat as lower charge-offs in Home Lending and Auto were offset by higher charge-offs in Card on loan growth. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across lending portfolios.
Now turning to Page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion and an ROE of 16% on strong revenue performance of nearly $10 billion. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 10% year-on-year. And outside of an accounting nuance, all of advisory, DCM and total IB fees would have been record for a first quarter. Advisory fees were up 12% in a market that was down, benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter. We ranked number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share.





Debt underwriting fees were up 21%, also outperforming a market that was down, driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead-left positions in leverage finance. We maintained our number one rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share. And equity underwriting fees were down 23%, but in a market down more, as the combination of the government shutdown, uncertainty around Brexit and the digital (ph) impacts from the December volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter. But already in the second quarter, we've seen a major recovery in US IPO volumes back to normalized levels, and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and healthcare sectors, which again dominate the calendar.
Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5.5 billion, down 17% reported, or down 10% adjusted for the impact of the accounting standard last year that I referred to. Big picture, on a year-on-year basis, we are challenged by a tough comparison. Backdrop in the first quarter of 2018 was supportive, clients were active and we saw broad-based strength in performance with a clear record in equities last year. In contrast, this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept clients on the sidelines, despite a recovered and more stable environment.
So with that in mind, I would categorize the results as solid and a little better than we thought at Investor Day just a few weeks ago, largely due to a better second half of March. And for what it's worth so far the environment in April feels generally constructive, but it's too early to draw any conclusions in terms of P&L. Fixed income markets revenue was down 8% adjusted, driven by lower activity particularly in rates and in currencies and emerging markets, which normalized following a strong prior year. However, we did see relative strengths in credit trading on strong flows as well as in commodities.
Equities revenue was down 13% adjusted, speaking more to the record prior year quarter (inaudible) performance, which was still generally strong across products. Although derivatives got off to a somewhat slower start, cash in particular nearly matched last year's exceptional results. Treasury services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, benefiting from higher balances and payments volume being partially offset by deposit margin compression. Securities services revenue was $1 billion, down 4% as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression, lower market levels and the impact of a business exit.





Of note, deposit margin in both treasury services and securities services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis, and at the firmwide level there's an offset. Finally, expense of $5.5 billion was down 4%, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower FDIC charges, partially offset by continued investments in the business. The cost to revenue ratio for the quarter was 30%.
Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6. A strong quarter for the Commercial Bank with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year on strong Investment Banking performance and higher deposit NII. Record gross IB revenue of over $800 million was up more than 40% year-on-year due to several large transactions and the pipeline continues to feel robust and active. Deposit balances were down 5% year-on-year and 1% sequentially as migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives have decelerated, and we believe is largely behind us. From here, we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook. Expense of $873 million was up 3% year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and in technology.
Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 2% or up 5% adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio. We continue to see solid growth across expansion markets and specialized industries. CRE loans were up 1% as competition remains elevated and we continue to maintain discipline given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs of $90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge-offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance.
Before we move on, I want to address the perceived gap between our reported C&I growth statistics and those that we will see in the Fed weekly data. If we look across all of our Wholesale businesses, we also show strong growth year-on-year at about 8%, but there are three comments I would make.





The first is that there can be reasonable noise in the Fed weekly data. Second, CIB is a big contributor for us, and CIB loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans. And third, as previously noted, the definition of C&I for the Fed does not include our tax-exempt portfolio, which has seen significant year-on-year declines given tax reform. So while it's true that the Fed data is showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples (inaudible) mainstream middle market lending space, we're seeing good mid-single digit demand in line with our expectations.
Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $661 million with a pre-tax margin of 24% and an ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as lower management fees on average market levels as well as lower brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year as continued investments in our business as well as other headcount-related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $10 billion with strength in fixed income, partially offset by outflows from other asset classes. Additionally, we had net liquidity outflows of $5 billion. AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both record up 4%, driven by cumulative net inflows in the liquidity and long-term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines.
Deposits were up 4% sequentially on seasonality and down 4% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows. Finally, we had record loan balances up 10% with strength in both Wholesale and Mortgage Lending.





Moving to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $251 million with net revenue of $425 million compared to a net loss of over $200 million last year. The improvement was driven by higher NII on higher rates as well as cash deployment opportunities in Treasury. And recall, last year, we had nearly $250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter. Expense of $211 million is up year-on-year and includes a contribution to the foundation of $100 million this quarter.
Completing on Page 9. To wrap up, this is (inaudible) that really showcases the strength of the firm's operating model, benefiting from diversification and scale, and our consistent investment agenda. We delivered record revenue and net income and a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter. Underlying drivers across our businesses continue to propel us forward, and in March and coming into April, the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructive. Client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum. Investor Day is only six weeks behind us so our guidance for the full year hasn't changed. We do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm's performance.
With that, operator, we'll take questions.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous.
John McDonald -- Bernstein -- Analyst
Hi, good morning. Marianne, you had good expense control this quarter, and your -- Jamie's letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio in each of the main business units for the next few years. Just kind of wondering what's driving that, is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that's going to occur in 2020 or is this kind of positive operating leverage carrying through?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





Yeah. Hey, John. So, I would say just big picture it's a combination of both obviously. We talked at Investor Day about the fact that we're always going to make the net investment -- the net incremental investment decision based on its own merit, but in total with the amount we're spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investments, we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years.
And so, that is -- obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but they are also to do with operating efficiency. So we do would also expect to start to see some of that drive operating leverage. But it's also in the case that we're looking for revenue growth too. So it's a combination of both.
John McDonald -- Bernstein -- Analyst
Okay. And then, just on the NII outlook, it's reassuring to be able to hold the Investor Day outlook of $58 billion for this year even though the curve's flattened, there were some concerns there. What are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we've seen?





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I mean, the first thing I would say is that we've said this before and we've seen these periods where you get kind of short-term fluctuations in the curve is that it's a bit dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so. And so, in the big picture, we said $58 billion plus, yes, it's true that a persistent flatter curve would have us more net drag on carry, and we're not immune to that. So, there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that if it is persistent at this level throughout the year, but we continue to grow our loans and our deposits. And against that, there's a mixed bag of lower for longer.
So, while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates, we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on bases necessarily. And while lower long end rates may be a net small drag in the short-term on earnings, there's the credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient Fed and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle. So, net-net, there are pluses and minuses. I would say, there may be some pressure as a result of that as it's persistent, but it's modest.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Hi . You mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over $20 billion year-over-year. So, those are the numbers. I was hoping for a little bit more on the why. And to what degree does that reflect your build-out of branches? How is that deposit growth growing? How much of this is related to digital banking? And then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength? I know that came up during the CEO hearings, the IMF study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail. Thanks.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





Yeah. So, look, I would say, there's lots of different opportunity for people to get insured deposit. So -- come back to the third point, but -- all of that plays a piece. So, you'll recall that we've built a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets in California and Florida and Nevada and the like. And so, we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase, and so we're definitely seeing some growth in deposits there.
I also firmly believe and we've talked about it many, many times that we've been investing consistently over the last decade in customer experience. Customer satisfaction in our consumer banking is at an all-time high and continues to increase consecutively. Digital products, new products and services, value propositions to our customers, convenience, new markets, all of which, I think, are increasingly important to our customers as well as obviously a number of other factors. So, to me, it's a combination of all of the above and less so, at this point, a perception of flight to quality, the people have a lot of choices.
Year-over-year, I would say, we're seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives. So, customers are voting with their business. They're bringing deposits to us, and I think it speaks to a combination of the investments we're making and also including branches.
Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst





So how much of the deposit growth is due to digital banking? Can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Well, I can tell you that -- I'm sorry, it's not just deposit growth. As far as I remember, it's also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwinds there. So I don't have a breakout for you. We can follow-up. It's decent, but our branch growth, the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence, both are important, but we can get back to you.

The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hi, thanks very much. On sec services, I heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on revs down. Could you talk about the business exit? I wasn't aware of that how big that is. And then, flip to the better side, you also did mention about organic growth. We haven't heard too much since the big trillion dollar win, but I know there is stuff going on underneath the covers. Talk about what type of business you are winning there.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





Yes. So, on the business exit, this is -- it's the sort of feature of always talking about year-over-year. To me this feels like really old news. It was a US broker-dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago, but obviously we're still on a year-over-year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues. It's about just over $20 million year-on-year revenue negative impact, but it's, relatively speaking, old news in terms of the exit took place last year. Lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on revenues.
And then, we are seeing solid underlying growth. But this is a very competitive environment, and as we are growing our custody assets, and as we're growing and winning new mandates, fees are under competitive pressures, and it also depends on mix. So there's a bunch of factors going on. What we are focused on is for both of these businesses that the long-term growth opportunities are very big, and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well. And even with these revenue pressures, we're focused on continuing to drive efficiencies, and these are good ROE businesses above mid-teens.
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Appreciate.





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry. I'll just make one more comment. Mike, I didn't say this on the digital space, but I think it's important as we think going forward that as we think not just about our digital assets, but digital account opening, and that has been a feature of how we are attracting new account 25% of checking production, 40% of savings production now able to be open digitally. So, increasingly digital will be a driver, but we will get back to you with the mix. All right?
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Marianne, just one quick qualifier on the seven-hour marathon the other day in DC. Besides finding out Jamie is a capitalist, that's shocking news, one of risks that I think that the Group talked about was in the private credit markets and non-bank lending. And I just wanted to...





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
...get a little qualifier of that. I'm pretty sure you didn't mean the exposure JPMorgan has to those, it's just more risk being taken, but if you can just expand on that, that would be helpful.





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, for sure, the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risks to those sectors. And our risks are that all the things that we've always told you about, which are relatively modest, relatively senior, well secured, well diversified, we look at -- losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable.
The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market. And while we wouldn't say necessarily that's systemic, being not systemic and suggesting that there won't be problems are two different things, not all non-banks are situated similarly. So there are some healthy fighting, well-capitalized, well and responsibly run companies, and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn.
So, the real question for all of this business that is migrated outside of banks is, how much of it will be unable to be rolled over, refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now. So it's not about us, but it's about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate within these markets going forward. But for a variety of reasons whether it's structured, whether it's capital liquidity pricing, that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market.





Jamie Dimon -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Can I just take the big numbers put on rolling, so obviously regulators keep an eye on it, and we're not particularly worried about it. Just to give you some facts, the banks, there's a $2.3 trillion. The banks have generally the senior piece, the A piece of about $800 billion or $900 billion. Then institutional investors, some of them are quite right, these are life insurance companies, funds, etcetera, owned BPs about $900 billion, and there's $500 billion what they call direct, and think of these as large funds. For the most part large funds, some are very capable, very bright, they have long-term capital. In the institutional piece that I mentioned, a lot of them are CLOs. And I know that people are worried about that, but if you actually look at the CLOs, they are more equity in those CLOs, they are more funded and both the direct piece and the CLO piece is more capital -- permanent capital. So, this system is OK. It's just getting bigger as more outside regulated sentiment. It should be something that should be watched, but it's not a systemic issue at this point.

The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.





Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hi, good morning.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.





Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
I had a question for Jamie. Jamie, in the shareholder letter, you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages, and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward. Could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you're thinking about there?
Jamie Dimon -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, if you look at the business, I mean, it is just costly. You have 3,000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements. It is litigious. You just look at history, you can see that, and it's becoming a huge -- non-banks are becoming competitors. And they don't have the same regulations, the same requirements in the servicing or production. So you're having that issue of servicing itself is a hard asset. And so we just want to -- we know it's an important thing for a bank. We also want -- and also we standardize capital since lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital. It's just a capital pod. Far more than it should be, if you look at it relative to the real risk embedded in holding mortgages. So we just want to have our eyes open, look at that, go through every piece, and structure it in a way that we're very happy going forward. We don't mind the volatility. We don't mind staying in the business. You got to look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it.





Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Okay. And then, separate topic, but just a question I wanted to ask because I got a couple of questions on it yesterday. The whole group of CEOs was asked, who do you think could succeed you? Would a woman or would a person of color succeed you? And I don't think you raised your hand. And just wanted to understand why and just hear from you, why you answered the question that way?
Jamie Dimon -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, what I should have said is that we don't comment on or speculation on succession plan. That's a Board level issue. It's not something you do in Congress, where you play your hand out in Congress, but also I was confused by a question likely without a timetable. So we have exceptional women. And my succession may very well be a woman, and it may not. And it really depends on the circumstance of the time, and it might be different if it's one year from now versus five years from now. So that's all of that was. I think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what you would likely mean was stuff like that. So I (inaudible) several people on the operating committee who can succeed me.





Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thanks. I appreciate that. That's the answer I expected. You -- we're going to give, we wanted to hear from you. So, appreciate that. Thanks.
Jamie Dimon -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the remarks on the mortgage business. We did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans. And Marianne, I know you spoke at Investor Day of the balance sheet optimization strategy, which could drive more growth in securities versus loans. I'm wondering if that what's really driving the slowdown that we saw in resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or a sustainable pace of core loan growth in 2019?





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, mortgages in 2018-2019 are the epicenter of the mortgage. So, the market itself is more year-on-year, it's about 15% smaller because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates are still higher year-on-year than they were this time last year. So that obviously is having an impact. And as we've been -- and we're down similarly. So we've added about $6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolio. But against that, as you saw last year, we did a number of loan sales and a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet. We're trying to take loans off of our balance sheet, core loans of our balance sheet, and sell them if we can reinvest in agency MBS and non-resi assets that has better capital liquidity characteristics. So, it's going to be a little bit harder to look at the trend. You're going to need to look at things grow. So we are originating high quality loans, we are adding a number of loans to our portfolio. We're distributing based on better execution as that would go, but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet.
Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Very helpful. And just a follow-up for me on CCAR. The Fed released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year, including some higher Card and Auto losses in the upcoming exam. I'm just wondering how does that inform the way you're thinking about capital return capacity. And are you still confident in that sustainability of 75% to 100% net payout as well as the 11% to 12% CET1 target?





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I didn't hear the second part of the question on losses, which losses were up this year that you were mentioning, but here is what I would say.
Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
The Card and Auto losses.





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the Fed model losses for our portfolios. And we've been observing that over time. Necessarily, it's the case that the Federal Reserve models are typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily, because they are industry wide. Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first.
So, we are growing our businesses responsibly every time we're adding branches, we're adding customers, we're adding advisors across our businesses. But to the degree that we have excess earnings, we'll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of February, nothing changed.

Next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning, Marianne. Quick question. I know you mentioned that the increase in NPLs within Wholesale was again idiosyncratic. But last quarter, there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter. Is there a way you can give more color as to specific drivers in there? I know you said in the past that you expect to normalize that you're off a low base. I got that, but I mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





Yeah. So, the color is, there is really no color, which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil, gas, energy releases out, you would've seen quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where there are $100 million (inaudible). So there's always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades. The thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have, whether we're seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow, and whether we're seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we're banking in, and we're just not.
So, it's not to say that we aren't playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle, it's not to say, we're playing close attention to retail, but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter. And even if you look quarter over quarter over quarter, there's no trend to call out, and we have a large wholesale lending portfolio. These are extremely modest in the context of that.
And remember, every quarter, like we talk about a few, because it's non-zero, but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter, and it's not just downgrades, it's upgrades, and they're approximately of equal measure. So, we're looking very carefully. I think we understand why people are questioning, concerned, and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle return, but we're not seeing it yet.
Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst





Okay. And then a separate question in the mortgage banking. It looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point over the last five years this quarter. Was that something in the market? Something with the rates? Or was there a one-off impacting that number this quarter?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
So, you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized -- and there's geography. In the Home Lending business, when we do these mortgage loan sales, because we're match funded, net-net, there's very little P&L. But last quarter, there was a loss in NIR and an offset in rate funding in NIR, this quarter there's a gain. So you've got a loss quarter, gain this quarter, both small, but nevertheless that's driving the majority of the production margin going up. But in addition, if you just strip all that noise out, which is not material, but nevertheless significant quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing.
Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst





Okay. Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst





Good morning, Marianne.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst





Can you share with us -- obviously you've got your de novo branching strategy moving forward. And what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So we're really, really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the United States. But when you talk about branches, you are talking about investment for the long-term, and when I say long-term, multiple years, decades. So with respect to the new markets that we're entering, these are extremely nascent investments, the branches, in many cases we haven't even broken ground on. However, that said, early indication -- these very, very early indications are strongly positive. We're seeing a lot of excitement in the market. We're seeing new accounts in production, a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage. On the whole, you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that.
Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst





Very good. And then, following up on some comments you made at Investor Day, and I believe touched on today about technology spending, if I recall correctly, next year technology spending should be self-funding and stabilized at just about where you are today. When you compare it to the past five years, what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology? Nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
So, I just want to reiterate something that I want to make sure you guys completely internalize, which is, we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we're getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past, but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit. That said, we've been growing our technology spend, and in particular, we've been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank. And that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital, R&D and the whole lot.
It's a large number, and each year, a lot of the dollars that we've been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them. So, this is not that we're going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very, very heavily in the agenda, and in particular in the technology agenda. It's just that each year (technical difficulty) and we'll continue to make the right decisions, and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been.





Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
And we're getting more efficient. So in the past, the way the technology was delivered was very different, and the more that we're in, our modern virtualized cloud-ready way with new technology, each dollar of technology is more productive.

Your next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.





Alevizos Alevizakos -- HSBC -- Analyst
Hi. I've got a quick question and a follow-up basically. My question is on the Treasury Services. Year-on-year, the growth going from double-digit, you just grow to 3% where apparently the volumes remained healthy, but the margins started to deteriorate. I wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019, especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic. Do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double-digit growth year-on-year for the remaining quarters? And my follow-up question is, we talked about change the bank versus run the bank for IT budget, can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you're spending on innovation? Thank you.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Okay. So first point on Treasury Services, obviously, revenue growth was in double digits, you're right, this quarter (inaudible) year-on-year. I mentioned earlier that for both of our Wholesale businesses, we happen to have basis compression between the funding spreads that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines. And so that just given where rates have moved headwind this year as the segment results are reported, but for the Company it's obviously net zero.





The more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue. So, you will see margins really compressed on that. It's not speaking to deposit flows, it's not speaking to volumes and it's not speaking to escalating payouts at this point. So we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business.
With respect to technology spend, you'll recall last year we were kind of 60-40 run the bank, change the bank, and it's more 50-50 this year, so $11.5 billion of spend about half and half.
Alevizos Alevizakos -- HSBC -- Analyst
Thank you very much.

Remember, in the change of the bank, it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience, digital, data, R&D, so it's the whole spectrum.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.





Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the net interest income, and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter. Is there anything that's lumpy or one-time that you'd flag? Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target at $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Okay. So, we did slightly better in the first quarter, two things driving it. One is small but nevertheless is arguably non-recurring, which is -- we've talked about the fact that overall in the Company when we do these loan sales that net-net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in Treasury, and it was a small gain in the first quarter in NII, call it, $50 million (ph) approximately.





And then, in addition, we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were high-yielding than IOER that continued into the first quarter. So we did benefit from that, and it may or may not continue, but we're not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through.
And so, I would say that day count was a drag. As we look forward with some opportunities, honestly obviously the risk associated with the flat yield curve, not big, but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure, its long end rates stay lower for longer. As we don't have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the December rate hike, you could see more rates paid to a little bit more into second quarter. So there are risks and opportunities. We still think it's a decent outlook, but I don't think it's conservative. I think its $58 billion is straight down the middle at this point. The trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short-term and we shouldn't over-interpret or over chase it. At this point, I think it's a decent estimate, and we'll continue to update you.
Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Okay. And then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities, are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago? You clearly seem more positive on the macro, and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook?





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Well, so, I mean, we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago. So, the sort of overall answer is, no, not really. We expected at that point that we would have a patient Fed. It turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish, which we couldn't generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk for the balance sheet. Obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration, but there's natural risk in our balance sheet. So, overall very little, we feel good about the credit. The curve is flat and we'll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold.
Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Erika Najarian -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Yes, hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up, Marianne, on the comments. In the backdrop for lower rates for longer, could you give us a sense on how you're thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale? In other words, I know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter, but when do you expect competition to taper off? And do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time?





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
So, I'll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same, which is, when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing, it is 100% driven by what we're observing in our consumer behavior than what we're seeing in deposit flows. And so, that's the environment that we look at to determine what's happening. And you've seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we've seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives, whether it's investments or whether it's more recently in CDs, and that may continue. We'll continue to watch that.
It is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end, and it's the short end that predominantly drives the sort of deposit pricing agenda. So, even if the curve is flatter, as long as it's because the front end is stable, I don't necessarily see deposit costs going down, but we're going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly.
Erika Najarian -- Bank of America -- Analyst





Thank you. And my follow-up question is, we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non-accruals was idiosyncratic. And I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
There are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter, but I would say it's a feature more of extremely low base. And so from that any movement whether they are up or down, it's somewhat exaggerated. But we would continue to call the credit environment benign.

Thanks. Marianne, just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you're seeing on the Consumer side versus the Wholesale corporate side in terms of -- the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year. Some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown, you are just still saying quite good. And then there is this unevenness about just CapEx and spending and corporate side, so just -- could you just kind of walk us through just where you're seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I mean I think that as it relates to US and in particular looking at the US Consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, auto, housing, spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust. And whether it's double-digits or whether it's not, we're continuing to see that -- and consumer confidence by the way, which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters. So, for us, US Consumer has always been strong and confident. And even if we're not all-time high and confidence is still very high, and generally the beta is -- and even some like housing and also that hasn't necessarily been super strong, is looking encouraging.
And then, on the global front, it is a little harder. But as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit, and Europe would be a good example, we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics in Brexit, and they seem to be fading a little, business confidence has recovered a little, businesses are still spending on labor, so generally a good side of the underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers. And even there there's job growth, there's wage growth helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having increase and eased. So, I think, generally, we feel optimistic across the Consumer and the rest of the sector, albeit it's sort of green shoots on the Wholesale buy. So, it's early, but it's what we were expecting to see and so it may continue.





Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Yeah. And one follow-up just on Investment Banking business, you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we've seen the reopening of the ECM market. Your general outlook just again on that global point about the -- a bit unevenness between US and global. Just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today? But had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter, but how is that side of the business you're feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I would say that a couple of things. Obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018. And so, we did benefit from that. But just as a general market matter, M&A is still attractive in a low growth environment, albeit a growth environment, investors are still constructive. North America, which is by far the biggest market for M&A, is still healthy. And so, Europe was a big driver last year and Europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue although we have a pretty good position there. So, I would say that the pipeline is down, but still M&A is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth.





Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst
That makes sense. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.





Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst
Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the NII outlook. I mean, I think we've talked about a flat curve. What kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating, it doesn't sound like you're in that camp, but if you were to get a rate cut, how do you manage that? How do you think the balance sheet reacts and NII reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Right. So, the market which is usually more, I would say, pessimistic, but more in that camp, (inaudible) expecting and ease at the end of the year. So, we are not by the way as you point out. So, I think for 2019's NII outlook, it's not a clear and present danger and there will be any. Obviously we have on the way up on rates, been over-indexed to total end rates. And so, clearly if we were to have an ease, it would have an impact on our NII.





If we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in, then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet. But right now, the Fed is on course. Right now, that's constructive for corporate deposit margins, constructive for credit, and generally constructive for how we're positioned on the balance sheet.
Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst
It's still you like you have room to, I guess, extend duration to kind of protect NII and NIM if that would happen?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





Yes, yes, we do.
Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Matt's question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness. This is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus, especially in CCB, but there weren't a lot of obvious non-core items really called out. So, Marianne, can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there is some idiosyncratic things that weren't necessarily called out during the call. You mentioned corporate cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there. So, are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call into question? How sustainable the results are?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer





So, first of all, just sort of big pic, first of all, really high I think is a bit of an overstatement -- higher, I think is fair. No, not really if there were, you know, we would have called them out. There are a few little things. So, I'm just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned. We contributed $100 million to the foundation this quarter. Net-net, even with a very, very small but nevertheless positive this quarter, so there's a few little bits and pieces like that. But if you look at revenue performance, we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting. We did better in IBCs and we gained a lot of share. We did a little better in markets. We did a little better in NII, so we just got a little bit of a wind on our backs sort of phenomenon.
My -- probably my best answer to you is, as happy as we are with the performance, and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we got in our businesses, we are not making material changes to our full year outlook. So -- we'll still see how market performed for the year. We do still expect, as Dimon mentioned at Investor Day, that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter, coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5% and 10% year-on-year. So, we do expect to gain share to help offset that, but last year was a record. So -- we haven't changed our full year guidance at all yet. We'll take this as a very good down payment to that. And if markets are constructive and wallet expands, we will benefit from that, but...
Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst
Okay. No, that's...





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
We're not leading across and changing everything.
Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst
That's helpful. I'll change gears a little bit. Any update on distressed capital buffer, what the Fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal?





Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
So, the best I know, there is a chance, but not necessarily a probability that there could be an SCB proposal for 2020 CCAR. So, there's a set of meetings or a meeting coming out sometime in the summer that I think might be an important moment. But we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand the better way to bridge growth capital together with point-in-time capital, but it's complicated. So, as we said, the most important thing is not to issue an SCB proposal, it doesn't deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively. So we're talking about GSIB, we're talking about minimums, we're talking about Basel, we're talking about SCB, it's complicated. I'd say there's a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 CCAR.
Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Marty.





Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- Analyst
Thanks for taking the question. Hey, good morning. First, I want to ask as going to CCAR, now we're getting into that season again, one of the things that I think has an impact is that -- what we had was a significant 30% plus growth in earnings last year. So if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward and you think of holding payout ratios so to say they were just constant, doesn't that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sales just to increase fairly significantly just off the increase in earnings last year?
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
I think -- yes, yes, if you look at payout ratios, obviously it's sort of described as a percentage. Then we said over the longer term, we'd expect to payout in a benign environment between 75% and 100%, and analysts have estimates of 90% plus. And obviously as earnings grow, that would be a bigger dollar number. But again, we'll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses, and its capacity not a promise. So, we'll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds. But you're right. As earnings continue to grow, a strong payout ratio, we're above the top end of our capital range. So, we are starting at a robust level, would be a higher dollar number, yes.





Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- Analyst
And then, Jamie, I was just curious. I think one of the issues facing the industry, and just we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old, and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time. And so, if we look at it, I think there's things that you're seeing or Marianne that you see inside the Company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon. So, just wanted to get your comment on that as well? That's my follow-up question. Thanks.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so I guess I -- sorry, go Jamie.





Jamie Dimon -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Some sort of number that's out that Australia had growth for 28 years. And just so I'm saying in notional, but you have to have a recession. They've had a lot of back winds, there's growth in Asia and stuff like that. But if you look at the American economy, the consumer's in good shape, the balance sheet's in good shape, people are going back to the workforce. Companies have plenty of capital, and capital expenditure is still up year-over-year, little bit less this quarter than last quarter. Capital is being retained in the United States. Business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high and not all-time peaks -- rather high.
So you can just easily -- it can go on for years. There's no law that says it has to stop. We do make a list, and look at all the other things, geopolitical issues, lower liquidity. So there maybe a confluence of events that somehow cause the recession, but it may not be in 2019, 2020, 2021. Obviously at one point though there will probably be something, and yeah, I think the bigger short-term risk would be something to go wrong in China, the trade issues in China. So, I just wouldn't account on there having to be a recession in the short run kind of years.
Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- Analyst





I agree, thanks.

Question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.
Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst





Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the end-of-period loans. So, if we look across the board, it looks like there are some contraction there on a quarter-to-quarter basis of about 3% of 4%. And I was just wondering if you saw that as a one quarter issue relating to what happened in 4Q '18. And if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies' CEOs (inaudible) emerging again.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So, quarter-on-quarter, and I think I mentioned a couple of these things, but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end-of-period basis, loans are down. So, like stepping through them, the first one I would point out is mortgage, and we just talked about that, I think, earlier in the call, which is we continue to originate mortgage loans. We continue to distribute them on portfolio. We did do a loan sale, which is part of the discussion that we've been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet. We did a sale at the end of the quarter. So that's impacting mortgage loans. In the CIB and one of the reasons why we call out core loan growth ex-CIB is because we don't consider CIB loans core, because they are just by their nature oftentimes more episodic and lumpy.
And so, we did see a see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter, which was fully syndicated into the first quarter. And then, in our other businesses in Asset & Wealth Management, a bit of seasonality, a few pay-downs in Card seasonality. So, it's just sort of combination of factors but I would say two drivers, CIB and Home Lending, CIB on sort of a large syndication, Home Lending on a loan sale (ph). Going forward, we'll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes. But just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending, I look at the middle-market space and say, we're still seeing solid demand. It is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries that we're still growing that portion of our loans in the mid-single digits year-on-year.





Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst
Yes. Great, thanks. So my following question is on...
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Before you go into that there are going to be other areas where we just won't (inaudible). I mean, in Commercial Real Estate, you see loan growth is much lower. It's very competitive. Its prices have come down. We continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans, but we're not going to chase it down and similarly Auto.





Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst
Sure. Okay, thanks. So my follow-on question is on CLOs. So, as some Japanese institutions are big buyers of US highly rated CLOs, but a few weeks ago, the Japanese FSA introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5% risk retention by US issuers in order for the Japanese institutions to buy them. So, I'm just wondering if you're seeing yet any change in demand from Japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there is any change in behavior from US CLO issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5% risk retention.
Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
So that is a great question. The answer I'm going to give you is not that I'm aware of at this point, but I'll have to follow up with you. Jamie are you aware? No? So, Andrew, we'll come back to you. Not that I'm aware of, but it is a good, but nevertheless quite detailed question.





Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- Analyst
